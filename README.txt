

The files included are pulled from different Riot Games websites.

It runs through each file individually, then grouped by game, then 
all of them and finds the most used words (minus common words). These
are then added up and put into a csv. After that all of the csvs are
combined.

The files in the documents folder are pretty unorganized, but it should
still run correctly and output to the right files.

I added the Tableau file to it for people to see and use.
