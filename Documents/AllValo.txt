
Q: Now that there are 7 maps in the rotation, will you be adding a map pick/ban system?

This is not something we're currently planning for regular Competitive queue play, because at this time we really want to reinforce learning how to play all maps (instead of always avoiding specific ones). That being said, we do believe a map pick/ban system is worth exploring in an environment fit for complex team strategizing like our planned tournament mode. It's still a work-in-progress, but we see its potential in a space where teams will have planned plays and Agent compositions for various maps—or maybe they just want to avoid yay's Chamber on Bind.

Q: Are you still working on a Gifting system?

We are definitely as excited about this idea as we were the first time we talked about it—initially targeting gifting by the end of 2020. That being said, the work behind a potential system is currently in our backlog mostly due to prioritizing other in-game changes, as well as exploring more comprehensive ways to bring it to VALORANT. No timeline as of today.

—Stephen Kraman, Product Manager

Q: Any updates on a possible in-game replay system?

Shortly after VALORANT’s launch we told you we were very much interested in exploring the feasibility of an in-game replay system to discover the best possible execution given a wide range of potential uses. The shortest answer today is that there is no plan for a player-facing version of a replay system, as of now.

We know this is a frequently requested feature from all types of players. Our exploration is continuous against developing our other VALORANT features (like new ways to track and reward Agent progress, player behavior tools, different ways to collect in-game items)—all to measure what makes the most sense to prioritize based on what serves the most players and has the most long term impact on game health.More directly, this exploration has helped us discover how we might use some of what we've learned to help improve observing in matches as well as evolving our live esports broadcasts.

Q: How come I report this clearly AFK player and never get reporter feedback?

Currently, reporter feedback only works when the reason why a player was punished is due to text/voice toxicity. For example, if you report a player for AFK-ing, and they get punished, you won’t receive a penalty message. We're working on this now! No exact date to share, but we’ll fix this so that if you report someone and they get punished, you will always receive a message. That does mean that as a result of this issue, there are cases where you may not have received a message that a player you reported was punished, even though the punishment may have actually happened.

But please, please keep the reports coming!

Q: Thoughts on alternating skins when on attack or defense?

We've seen an appetite for getting additional use out of your current collection, so we're actually already exploring the feasibility of an idea like this. There are no commitments to share today and here is why. The team needs to first understand/test the limits of performance and memory so that you don't see any negative impacts in and out of the game. We would also need to consider making any potential updates to the collections page to properly showcase/support this in the current collections menu. Finally, among some other unknowns, are there already other concepts in progress that may compete with this idea in some way.

Q: Arcane was amazing—will we see a VALORANT Netflix series?

Arcane was amazing! We'd be lying if we claimed not to have hopes and dreams of one day delivering something of that stature in the VALORANT Universe but wow, our LoL cousins set an insanely high bar with the series!

From the outset, we set out to create an expansive universe with depth of characters to support any potential future experiences that we believe players would want, including premium entertainment.

BUT…don't expect anything too soon. We’re going to remain hyper-focused on the game for quite some time and we have plenty we still want to do to keep expanding the universe in support of VALORANT the game.
Will you make it so we can hide account levels?

A

We’ve seen the feedback on account levels sometimes used as fuel to be toxic to another player (be it their rank-to-level ratio, or something else). We hear you and we're working on it right now (along with some other minor improvements to Account Leveling). It'll take a couple of patches to wrap development and release the change, but we intend that those of you who don't wish to share your Account Level can obscure it.

Q

I’m usually Gold, but this Episode I’m Silver. When I look at ranked population websites it seems like a lot of people are Silver, why are people lower rank in this Episode?

A

A good place to start is to look at the changes made in Episode 3 intended to refine our matchmaker. These changes have improved match fairness, and we’ve seen fairly positive data results from them. Unfortunately, these same changes also affected everyone's MMR. To be clear, this change hit all of you the same, so everyone's actual MMR number went down by a small percent.

Now that we have gathered enough data, we can comfortably say our lower ranks have too many people in them, and our higher ranks not enough. This is what we call Ranked Distribution: the population of players in each rank. Since your rank is tied to your MMR, this led to the whole playerbase situated in a rank lower than intended (by a small amount).

Lots of websites track this data, so we are just going to show you what our current ranked distribution looks like in Act 1 in the next image (remember, Radiant is always top 500, so it is not shown here):

08272021-AskVal_August_2021_Graph_1-inline.jpg

Our target now is to adjust the distribution so as to reduce the amount of players in Silver, and move everyone up to the ranks they belong. Below is our goal for ranked distribution in Act 2:

08272021-AskVal_August_2021_Graph_2-inline.jpg

To reiterate, the above data is our goal for ranked distribution. But because the community is always shifting in skill slightly, it may not be exact. This is a complex subject, if there is anything to take away from this post it’s that it should be a little easier to climb a few ranks in Episode 3 Act II. See you out there!

Q

Will you ever release skins again via the rotating shop?

[Editor’s Note: This answer originally appeared via Joe Lee’s Twitter, which you can follow here.]

A

There's always a lot of discussion around VALORANT's rotating shop but we made a key strategy change about a year ago when we released Sakura in the rotating store for the first time. Many of you loved the aesthetic and were rabid to acquire it.

We originally planned to release almost half of our skins via the rotating shop, but seeing the hype around Sakura we wanted to make sure that all of you had access to a skin line when it was released. So, we turned all of our rotating releases into Featured releases after that.

Yes, the rotating store still exists but all of you have equal access to new skins at the launch window (when demand for that skin is at its highest).

Finally, this isn't to say that we will never have skin lines that are introduced exclusively in the rotating store. There are some exciting ways in which it could make sense for a skin line to be released that way, but those will be few and far between.
What are you doing about performance? Why is my Frames Per Second (FPS) unstable sometimes?

A

VALORANT has an entire team dedicated to maintaining and improving the performance of the game. In VALORANT, lower spec machines tend to be GPU bound (rendering is the bottleneck for your FPS), whereas mid to high spec machines tend to be CPU bound. Because many of you are CPU bound, adjusting graphics settings may not help performance because the CPU is limiting FPS, not the GPU.

Maintaining performance involves setting budgets (data, not finances) for new content that is added to the game, such as maps, characters, and modes—as well as monitoring client and server performance internally across a variety of specs prior to a patch, and externally once a patch is released. This allows us to either catch an issue before release or, in the worst case, track down issues that you are experiencing in the live game.

Currently, we are focused on improving CPU performance. This can be done by either improving baseline performance, which results in an average higher FPS or by removing hitches, which will reduce how much FPS drops when there is a more expensive workload.

We’ve identified issues with Viper and Astra and will be working on optimizations to their abilities over the next few patches. We will be doing a pass on performance for all Agent abilities over the coming months. The overall goal is to increase the lowest FPS you see regardless of what is going on in a match. We are also working on VALORANT’s ability to make use of multithreading to better leverage modern CPUs.

FPS can seem unstable at times because of how rounds play out. Early parts of the round are spent gathering information and watching fights between a fewer number of players. Later in the round when players are attacking or retaking a site, we tend to see many bodies fighting each other and increased ability usage, all of which can decrease FPS.

Additionally, performance can vary between modes. For example, performance on the Shooting Range is often high because there is only one player being simulated. Deathmatch can see worse performance than the standard Unrated/Competitive modes because there are more players in Deathmatch and most of the game is spent fighting each other.

If there’s one take away for you it’s this: Whether you’re on the latest hardware or VALORANT’s min spec, we want all of you to be able to focus on playing the game and not fighting performance.

Q

When’s 5-stack coming back?

A

We’ve heard the feedback, and we agree that VALORANT is at its best when played in a group. We have two ways we are thinking about this space:

How can we enable five-stacks, with wide ranges of skill, to compete in ranked?
How can we create a high-stakes competitive experience for teams?
When thinking about the first question, we have significant concerns regarding splitting queues. We don’t believe splitting the queue—or doing a flex queue—is the best solution for VALORANT. We fear that one ranked queue would become “The Real Ranked Queue” and the other queue becomes less prestigious.

Our other concern is match fairness. By having one ranked queue, we have a bigger pool of players lowering queue times and enabling stricter matchmaking. So while designing for this issue, we want to make sure whatever solution we go with maintains competitive integrity.

For the second question, we are excited to announce…. Oh hey, Hiko posted a video with ranked feedback. Yeah, I need to go watch this. Sorry! I can tell you more at the beginning of Episode 3, as it’s a little early to talk about what we are doing to solve that issue.

Q

Why can’t you kill the crabs on Breeze? (via Freddiepon)

A

The crabs on Breeze have been living and breeding near some Radianite fallout and have likely developed fortified exoskeletons. We advise against any crab battles, unless you’re prepared to lose an eye. Doesn't matter much anyway, within a few years time they’ll probably take over the island. But I'm no crab expert.
My matches sometimes feel like a coin flip. I feel like I go against players that don't belong in my rank, are smurfs common?

A

Smurfs and Smurfettes, while relatively small in number, are absolutely real and are frustrating to play against. We’ve been collecting and incorporating feedback from all our channels, and have since spun up an investigation into the current state of smurfing in VALORANT.

Because we’re currently deep in this investigation, there is no actionable plan to share just yet. However, we want to at the very least provide insight into the fundamental questions our team is actively tackling:


How do we identify smurf in our systems, and how often are players running into them?
Why do players smurf?
Is there a need, that isn’t being met, that is forcing players to smurf?
What changes do we need to make in order to combat smurfing?

For those that encounter smurfs, we know it’s tough to stomach that there’s no immediate solution today, but we have to make sure that we are approaching this complex space in the right way without screwing up other systems. We want to understand exactly what your needs are and how we can better serve you all!

For example, we’ve noticed that a big chunk of smurfs do so with no malicious intent—they’re trying to play competitively with friends outside of their rank. Whereas, there may still be a minority who create smurf accounts with bad intent.

Combating smurfing is not only about punishment, it’s also about making VALORANT more accessible so those without bad intentions no longer feel the need to smurf. Once we are at a point where we feel comfortable with the solution we have in place and feel like we have mitigated these reasons, that’s when we will be able to put a foot down on the remaining folks—potentially booting them from our game.

We want to emphasize that this is one of the competitive team’s primary focuses at the moment, and although we are in the investigation phase, and it will take us some time to act on our findings, know that we are listening and agree that this is a problem worthy of heavy resources.

Hey, while we’re here, it’s probably good to note that although playing against players who appear to be “boosted” can be a tilting experience, our findings show that smurfing isn’t actually as prevalent as some of the community might have you believe. Yes, sometimes you may have just happened to stumble across someone who was simply having a really good game. To be clear, we are not denying or diminishing the severity of the smurfing problem space and are fully committed to working with you all on combating it. But next time you see a player doing really well, remember that maybe, just maybe, they’re simply poppin’ off.

Q

Any updates on the replay system?

A

Talks are ongoing with multiple internal teams interested in a VALORANT replay system. No, we can’t share any updates as of now, but know that these early discussions are in earnest and we should have an update for you all soon™ :^)
Can you explain the reasoning behind the regional slot distribution for Masters: Reykjavik?

A

One of our biggest goals for 2020 was to launch international events as quickly as possible. As planning was going on for the League of Legends Mid-Season Invitational, we were presented with an opportunity to utilize that event’s infrastructure to execute an international 10-team VALORANT LAN earlier than anticipated. With this team limit, our first priority was to make sure each of our seven VALORANT regions was represented at our first global event.

Subsequently, we had to make some tough decisions with the remaining three slots. As we were trying to make these decisions, we looked at each region’s playerbase, viewership, esports infrastructure, and team participation within regional VCT tournaments; criteria that EMEA, North America, and Brazil all scored especially high on. Ultimately, we chose to grant an additional slot to each of those regions to optimize for regional diversity at the first international event. We think this will lead to a more exciting tournament, but we may make changes to future slot allocations based on learnings from Reykjavik.

We’re also really excited about the future of LATAM, JP, KR, and SEA. As our events grow, you'll see more teams from those regions at future international events. We think the future is bright in all of our regions and we’re looking forward to having bigger international events with even more regional diversity.

Q

How are casters for regional broadcasts selected? Who can cast in which region?

A

This year there has been a lot of discussion on how regional broadcasts select their casters, and whether casters from one region could cast VCT matches of another region.

Early on in VALORANT Esports, some broadcast teams experimented with utilizing casters from regions that were geographically distant from the participating players and production hubs. This led to a large variance of audio delays, as signals travelled back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean, and then to distributed broadcast teams.

These delays were especially pronounced during live matches which involved casters hailing from different continents. For regional broadcasts, there are technical limitations that impact broadcast quality when using casters who are very geographically distant from each other and Riot’s broadcast teams.

After First Strike, to optimize for the best available broadcast quality, we opted to build VCT shows around casters that were geographically close to the competition and broadcast team. For Masters: Reykjavik, we are planning on producing a unified English broadcast that will feature representation from multiple regions. This is a similar approach to League of Legends, where we utilize casters that are near to each other. 

-     Stefan Richardson, Senior Manager of Global Broadcasts at Riot Games

Q

What is the philosophy behind the Masters points structure for this year?

A

When determining how teams would qualify into Champions this year, we had one main goal - make it the most competitive tournament possible. To do that, we needed to weigh a variety of factors. First, we wanted to ensure that we were rewarding teams who have shown consistent results throughout the year. However, we also wanted to ensure that we were valuing the recency of results - finishes closer in time to Champions are likely a better indicator of success than finishes months earlier. Finally, we considered the fact that as we move to international competition, the difficulty of winning Masters grows.

This all resulted in our existing Masters points structure. We believe that the balance of lower points at the Regional Masters events, followed by an increase in available points heading into Masters: Reykjavík, and an additional increase in points heading into Stage 3 Challengers (along with the automatic qualification into Champions for the winning team) will help us meet our goals.

It's important to remember that Championship Points will also count towards seeding at the Last Chance Qualifiers, pan-regional tournaments that will select the final teams for Champions, not just for qualification into Champions itself.

For those of you who want to read more, we recently published a detailed breakdown on the 2021 VCT that offers more specific details.

Q

Will regions who are currently not participating in official VALORANT Champions Tour events be able to qualify for Champions?

A

As we welcome new players into VALORANT, we want to expand competitive opportunities in their regions. Tournament circuits like Strike Arabia, that while not part of the VCT, will allow for players in the Middle East and North Africa to participate in the EMEA Last Chance Qualifier (and have a path towards Champions). We want to take a similar approach with other new regions, leading to larger, more competitive, and more inclusive LCQs later this year.

Q

When are coaching slots coming to VAL?

A

It’s official, coaching slots are coming in patch 2.08! As an esport, we continue to be excited at the prospect of coaches playing a larger role in matches and plan to provide more analytical tools in the future.

Overall, we see the coach and player relationship as an important dynamic in our esport. We have some ideas on where we want to take this and will be talking with players (specifically In-Game Leaders) and Coaches in the near future to solidify our plans. 

What you’ll see in 2.08 is the basic foundation of this feature and something we plan to continuously innovate on. We look forward to evolving coaching and its supporting features with help from VCT participants.
What is your approach when you see abilities not being used as intended? 

A

We've seen a lot of Agent abilities used in unintended ways by players, sometimes with awesome outcomes and sometimes in ways that we've needed to address. Sage's Barrier Orb is a fantastic example—we've seen countless creative boosts, sideways tube walls, and ability combos that we wouldn't have expected. On the flip side, we've seen floating walls creating one-ways, single wall segments hovering over the Split B bomb site, and more Omen teleport bug combos than I'd like to remember.

We walk a pretty constant line between the sandbox nature of abilities that keeps each game exciting, and trying to determine if newly discovered interactions are enriching or breaking the tactical game we've promised. VALORANT is definitely a game that we're building and exploring hand-and-hand with our community. We know you all approach each match with creativity, and the best thing we can do is keep an open dialogue about what's discovered.

—Jay Watford, Lead Character Designer

Q 

Can you add the ability to change settings during Agent selection? 

A

We agree, this should be doable and we'll add it to our backlog. To be frank though, it's behind some much more urgent priorities on our list. We'll keep you updated.

Q 

Did HRTF lower the volume or the ability to hear the footsteps? It seems far away steps are now harder to hear but you can pinpoint them easier. 

A



HRTF does not affect attenuations (volume change over distance) or occlusion (filtering change based on objects between the emitter and the listener). Adjusting to HRTF does take time and practice.
I get less Ranked Rating per win and more per loss, and it feels like the system is holding me down. Why is that?

A

Buckle up, this answer will take you on the wrinkle brain highway. We are going to get a little in the weeds, and have to explain how our ranked system functions in order to answer this!

VALORANT MMR AND WHY IT’S NOT THE SAME AS RANK RATING (RR)
VALORANT uses a Match Making Rating (MMR) system to target your performance skill level. MMR is a giant ladder, consisting of all players. If you win, you climb up and push others down. Alternatively if you lose, you get pushed down by others. No two players can tie, or take up the same spot on the ladder. This is the core concept for most matchmaking systems, and the math that determines how fast you climb up (or push others down) is the hard part. 

MMR is a fairly fluid system that can potentially change substantially game to game. We’ve kept this slightly decoupled from your visible rank and RR so we can make sure that you don’t experience wild swings in your rank or instantly demote after a promotion.

That’s your base understanding of MMR, so now let’s explain how that relates to your Ranked Rating gains and losses.

To start, we need to reiterate that your Rank is separate from your MMR. You will never see your MMR—it’s what we use to create fair matches. When you queue into ranked for the first time, or after an Episode reset, we have an idea of where your “Rank” belongs because we rely on your MMR as a guideline. Unfortunately we only have an “idea,” so we place you on the low end of where we think you belong.

CONVERGENCE
We place you on the low end mainly to reach what’s known as “convergence.” We believe it’s better to place you on the lower end of our rank estimate, and then test whether that is actually low by asking you to prove you belong at the higher rank. You pass, and your Rank Rating (RR) will reflect this. You’ll see more RR per win, and less per loss—all on the way toward the high end of the Rank you are being “tested” for. Voilà! You are now “converging” to your MMR. 

Eventually your Rank will converge very close to your MMR (unless of course, you begin to lose, then your MMR will begin to drop). When this happens you will get a relatively even amount of RR per win/loss. Now that you’ve reached your MMR, you’ll need to improve in skill and win against your opponents more than you lose in order to climb above our original estimates. When you are at your MMR, we’ve most often seen you with a 50% win rate. Even with a 50% win rate, you could go on a long winstreak and promote to a rank above your MMR.

Just because a player has a good winstreak, or a few good games, does not change the fact they are still only maintaining a 50% win rate and now have promoted above their MMR. This, along with demotion protection, will sometimes lead to players sitting one rank above their MMR.

PROTECTING COMPETITIVE INTEGRITY
If you do end up with a rank above your MMR, the system will try to push you back to your intended rank—this is what losing more RR on a loss, than gaining on a win, looks like. This is something you can fix by winning more matches than the players above you who are around your current MMR. This was an issue seen even by top players on the leaderboard. When there are very few players ahead of you it can become very difficult to climb. If your MMR isn’t truly above a player ahead of you, the system does not want you to take their leaderboard spot. 

We believe the integrity of Competitive play would be compromised if we let those on the leaderboard “out grind” their MMR and pass someone they don’t truly belong in front of. So all players are held to the same standards: In order to climb you must prove you are better than those above you. So, if you are winning slightly over half your games and have 200 wins, but another player is winning the vast majority of their games but only has 100 wins, that player with 100 wins will likely sit higher on the leaderboard because of their MMR.

Ranked is about finding your true skill and we will hold you accountable to the skill level you are playing. If you truly outperform your opponents and win more than you lose, you will climb that ladder and increase your MMR. Again, when you raise your MMR, you’ll then increase your RR gains and open the door for an easier climb!

031821_AskVALArticle_ValCompet.jpg

TL;DR
If your MMR is higher than your rank, you’ll gain more RR on wins than you lose on losses
If your MMR is even with your rank, you’ll gain and lose closer amounts of RR for wins and losses
If your MMR is lower than your rank, you’ll gain less RR on wins and lose more on losses
Increase your MMR by outperforming your opponents and winning more consistently!

THE END, WE SWEAR
Whew, that was long. MMR and Ranked systems are necessarily complex given the sheer amount of skill and performances it must handle. This is just a small example of the calculation, and there are lots of reasons why we chose to go this direction with ranked currently. 

That being said, we know it can feel frustrating to lose more RR then you are gaining. We are investigating solutions to prevent your Rank from pulling well ahead of your MMR, as well as trying to figure out if we can make it feel better when it occurs. Due to issues like these, you may see minor math tweaks to RR gains in future Acts. We are also always listening and will continue to communicate our changes in patch notes and social, but hopefully not in another Ask VALORANT.
Can you explain the reason for the planned Rank Rating penalty for queue dodge? Sometimes I have real good reasons to dodge and I don't think I should lose RR.

A

We understand a Ranked Rating deduction—no matter how small—can feel like a painful penalty, so we want to be extremely clear with how this system works and why. First thing’s first: these changes target players who repeatedly queue dodge, and will have minimal impact on players who only queue dodge occasionally. We hope having a small (3-point) rank rating deduction provides additional deterrence for players who frequently dodge—without being too punishing for the person who rarely dodges. We've also kept it quick to earn back your rank rating, while not impacting your MMR with these penalties. However, repeated queue dodges will add up, and repeat queue dodgers will feel the intended pains of this.

For reference, our data says that more than 50% of dodges are caused by less than 2% of players, and the vast majority of players very rarely queue dodge, if at all. Targeting those repeat offenders should have a massive impact on how frequently you encounter queue dodges in your own games.

All that said, we recognize that queue dodging is an important tool to avoid really painful situations (like toxic teammates). And even if most queue dodges are caused by a small group of people trying to manipulate their competitive experience, we don’t want to take that safety net away from you. That’s why our systems have high forgiveness for infrequent offenders.

A final note: we will be watching the impact of these changes closely when we ship them (targeted for patch 2.05). If we missed the mark—whether we don’t reduce queue dodging enough, or we punish our more well-intentioned players too harshly—we’ll make adjustments to the system. Simple as that. And we’ll keep you updated with any changes.

Q

When are devs going to make knife hit detection system more accurate? Escalation revealed some of its shortcomings.

A

Our knife is a bit of a meme right now. It’s serving the purpose of either psychological-driven kills on unaware opponents or a last resort when out of ammo—but it's rarely a decent (or reliable) choice to use in any other situation.

The hitbox is static, unintuitive, and only active for a very brief period of time. This leads to frustration and confusion when combined with visuals that imply the knife does damage during the entire slash motion. These are things we'd like to improve, but other weapon balance issues generally take priority over this work because the knife isn't intended to be a critical part of our combat model. We don’t think it should ever be the best choice in a fight, but we would like to make it feel better to use by improving its reliability and hit satisfaction, as well as allowing it to be a viable (but not necessary) weapon choice in some situations.

For Escalation, we were hoping to take a pass on the knife to give the knife level an extra "oomph,” but we ran out of time and to do so would have significantly delayed the mode. So, we shipped "BIG KNIFE" instead, hoping that a speed/jump boost, a longer range, and more damage would make that level at least bearable if not good. We hope to come back in the future and give the knife a closer look and the love it deserves—we just need to figure out when it makes the most sense.
Last year, you mentioned looking into Agent-specific keybinds. Do you have any updates?

A

While we have no specific timing to give you today, believe us that this has not dropped off our long list of priorities for this year. Our hope is to find a version of this around Episode 3.

Q

Are you considering extending the period for a match remake vote?

A

We recognize there are some problems with the remake system and are actively looking at improvements. We were relatively strict in our initial approach to ensure competitive integrity and avoid any matchmaking abuse, but agree that this has limited the feature’s usefulness. 

Extending the available window, automating the remake function in particularly fast AFK cases, and creating clarity on when a remake is being initiated versus a surrender, are all pieces that we’re considering. We still want to maintain competitive integrity as our number one priority, so our approach will reflect that. We’re hoping to have some changes on this soon and will give you more updates when we can.

Q

Would you consider reducing the Agent selection time for Spike Rush? A short mode feels like it should have a short start time.

A

We saw this discussion bubble up in some places, but to put it plainly, we're happy with player satisfaction and play time for Spike Rush, so we’re going to leave the Agent select time as is, for now. FWIW, a shorter Agent select window might result in significantly more dodges, which may (at a macro scale) actually increase the length of the mode for all of you. Also worth noting that the current time is to help account for different load-in times per player.
Last month, you mentioned you’re working on decreasing the running+shooting accuracy, can you update us on the progress or what you are looking to adjust?

A

We have some changes planned for Patch 2.02 that should help address sentiment on running accuracy with rifles. Keep in mind, we're making sure not to change too many systems at once to ensure that shooting doesn't feel so dramatically different that you’ll have to relearn habits. As always, we'll keep an eye on the change and will continue to adjust as necessary.

Q

At the start of the Act, it seems like I can rank higher and faster with my alternate accounts, whereas I’m stuck in the much lower ranks for longer with my main account. Is the new ranked system working as intended?

We saw this weird pattern developing soon after launch and made changes to help solve this with Patch 2.01. It should actually be optimal now for the highest ranked players to use their main account instead of their alternate due to the now reduced queue times—and their higher MMR will actually help them earn rank rating faster.

We will also be increasing the effectiveness of convergence, expected to hit in one of the next patches. This will make it so previous season Immortal+ players, that still have a high MMR, will start to earn more Ranked Rating per win and less per loss then their lower MMR counterparts. Ultimately they will climb the leaderboard faster, and make it so that the most effective way to climb the leaderboard is to have skill and high MMR. This will affect all ranks, so if you really are hardstuck Silver—but your MMR says you should be Gold or Plat—you will get there quicker.

Unfortunately, one week under the slightly wonky Patch 2.0 system was enough time for top players to rally behind the effort to rely on their alternate accounts for quicker rank. When people played on an alt, they may have been finding matches quicker and ranked up faster. Now, in the long run, their alt will be at a lower MMR and earn less ranked rating per win then they would have if they were on their main account (with higher MMR).

That being said, we know there are a few recent Competitive changes around Episode and Act starts that some of you are unhappy about. We’re looking at adjusting how we place you at the start of a new Act and how quickly leaderboards become available. We’ll also have a more detailed follow up to share ahead of Episode 2 Act II.
The ranking system feels harsh right now, it seems hard to climb out of lower ranks and easy to derank. What are you doing to address this?

A

We hear you on this, too often one bad day of play can result in significant rank loss and a good day doesn’t help you climb as much as you’d like. Our rank distribution bands are unforgiving and we have limited protection against rank demotion. We’ve been feeling this ourselves, and we’ve made some changes to address this with Patch 1.14, and more substantive changes will follow at the start of the year with the launch of Episode 2.

To be specific with Patch 1.14’s updates, we updated our rank distribution to make it easier to climb out of the lower ranks, significantly reducing the number of players in Iron and increasing the players at Bronze through Diamond ranks (Immortal+ will stay roughly the same). With patch 2.0 (early January), we’re going to add increased protection for rank demotions, while giving you some initial buffer room after you gain ranks. There are also going to be a TON more changes to the rank system with Episode 2, and we’ll have more info on that to come in early January next year.

Q

I know we only get one surrender vote per half, but in the case of a disconnect after the first vote, can we get an extra surrender attempt?

A

While we don't see an issue outright with getting a sort of buffer between votes rather than just the one-and-done, we're going to be frank and say this is not at the top of our to-do list for now (AFK, Smurf, etc are hoarding that spot). We'll review and see if this makes sense, but no promises just yet.

—Sara Dadafshar, Producer

Q

Is there any way to hide my crosshair from anyone observing me? I get harassed for my crosshair in almost every game, and it's really putting me off from playing.

A

Sorry to hear you're getting harassed over crosshair choice. We allow players to spectate other crosshairs so they can get inspiration for their own, but I can definitely see how the consistent comments could become annoying. I think being able to hide your crosshair is a great idea— we'll try to fit it into our future plans and keep you posted on any changes.

—Matt Le, Producer

Q

Will there be a “story mode” for VALORANT?

A

It's definitely our goal for players to discover more about Agents and their stories in the future. Right now, some of those details are seeded into the game itself, in Player Cards, Character VO, etc. —there are a lot of places where you can find and piece together snippets! However, a traditional story mode is not in our current plans but....never say never. Our goal is always to listen to players and so we will continue to adapt and create experiences based on what you are telling us you want.
I would love to know what exactly are you going to do about the AFKs/throwers situation? Harsher punishment? Adding a “leaver rating”?

A

Getting an AFKer in your match is definitely tilting, and we're looking into ways to lessen this type of behavior in game. To start off, you'll notice that we are implementing an update in 1.14 that changes the requirements to unlock ranked mode to "games won" rather than "games played." We hope this will force players who are just spam farming matches to actually participate in play and strive for wins. Look for more details in the upcoming patch notes.

Second, we are working on better detection of this type of behavior that will lead to harsher punishment. We're looking into things like rank penalties, experience mitigations, longer queue time restrictions, and even bans if it comes down to it. We want to distinguish between disruptive behaviors that stem from comms and gameplay, and then penalize accordingly. I can't give away our secrets in terms of what our plans for detection are, but know that we are actively working on a way to make the game more enjoyable in this regard! Hopefully you’ll be able to see some meaningful change in the coming year as we roll out these changes incrementally.

—Sara Dadafshar (Killjoy), Producer

Q

You mentioned before that part of the way you fight smurfs is to boost players who overperform. Is there any way to flag players who lose 20 games in a row?

A

If you legitimately lost 20 games in a row trying to win then my heart goes out to you. That being said, it’s far likelier that if someone has lost this many games in a row then they are intentionally feeding. You should report players for this, and this can lead to penalties for the player such as chat and voice restrictions and potentially even bans for repeat behavior.

—Ian Fielding, Senior Producer

Q

Would you consider adding the ability to block players so we can never queue with them again?

A

Interesting idea! There's some nuances we'd have to work through to ensure queue times don't significantly increase, but we understand how frustrating it is when you get matched up with someone who you just reported in the prior match. We'll think on this a bit, but know that we are currently working on better detection of disruptive behaviors in hopes of being able to appropriately administer penalties and hopefully lessen the number of players you wouldn't want to play with to begin with.
I’d really like to know how many hours my friends and I have spent in the game. Is it possible to add this feature?

A

We want players to have ways to show off their investment in VALORANT whether that's their ability to climb the ladder or to showcase how long they've been playing. We're still exploring the most exciting way to do so but rest assured there will be ways to display your dedication in the future.

—Miles Metzger, Revenue Strategist

Q

Will we ever be able to transfer account regions without losing hundreds of dollars of skins and hundreds of hours of progress?

A

This is something we definitely know is important, and it’s on our list behind a couple of other critical priorities for VALORANT. We'd like it to be sooner, but it's looking this option will be available towards the middle of 2021.

—Naoise Creaven, Senior Producer

Q

Have you thought about having certain patches for tournaments exist on their own servers?

A

Tournament Realms (basically, a private server) are something we're actively pursuing and are coming soon™. For First Strike, we were only planning to use a separate patchline (consider this Tournament Realm-lite) for the main event, but ended up launching this early to allow tournaments to continue on the same patch they started on. This has allowed us to keep esports on a separate patch from live and is something we're bringing back globally for the First Strike main event Dec. 3–6.

In the future, we'll have fully flushed out Tournament Realms that will give us even more control over the environment that esports is played on. We'll have specific rules around what patches cab be used for certain tournaments to help create the best environment for competitive play. We're extremely focused on competitive integrity and will continue to adapt our plans in collaboration with both devs and players.
Patch stability has been really bad these days. What’s going on?

A

Oof, yeah this one stings. Our day zero patch stability has honestly been far below our own expectations recently. There are many different reasons for this, from internal process improvements we have to make, to some philosophical changes we should consider, investment in tooling and infrastructure. Honestly, we could even include maybe slowing down a bit.

We’ve been rigorously keeping to the two week patch cadence since even before we started our Closed Beta. Even with the logistical challenges of working from home, the team has been—and continues being—incredibly passionate to get content and features out as quickly as possible, including moving up our maps release schedule. But it’s time to take a breath and take stock of what we need to do internally to make sure that our efforts are sustainable and hitting the quality bar you, our players, deserve.

Now that the biggest fires from the 1.11 deploy (and rollback and redeploy) are out, we’re going to take a few weeks to do a thorough investigation into our processes and tools as well as make sure we have a roadmap for improvements that allow us to continue shipping all the amazing stuff we have planned—sustainably and at a higher quality bar.

We want this to be as transparent as possible so you know what improvements to expect and what to hold us accountable for, so we’ll get back to you before we leave on holiday break with an overview and roadmap of what actions we’ll be taking.

Until then, thank you for your patience, understanding, and support.

—Arnar Gylfason, Senior Producer

Q

I noticed that the latest patch dropped during the NA Qualifiers for First Strike, but then got rolled back. Are you thinking about esports tournaments as you patch? What if these patches are too disruptive?

A

First: thank you for your patience with all of this. Timing esports events in between game patches is a pretty complicated process, especially since VALORANT updates...every two weeks. The dev team did think they made all the changes in time for the qualifiers (see the foreword they wrote for the patch notes), and we’ve been working closely with them to sync schedules. However, this got too squishy and some of the NA Qualifiers ended up on the wrong side of a Tuesday.

This should have been a better experience and we’re definitely looking to improve with the lessons we’ve learned. So here’s what happened: going into the end of the year, both the development and esports teams badly wanted to unlock true Best-of-Fives for the First Strike Main Event by releasing the fifth map, Icebox. We felt Icebox would need four weeks in the ranked queue to provide pros enough time to practice on the map before including it in competition.

We also wanted to keep the next patch (1.12)—which would drop midway through First Strike—light in order to minimize potential disruption. To account for all of this, the VALORANT dev team frontloaded a lot more than the usual amount of content into patch 1.11 and released a map earlier than planned. This led to an unstable experience, and ultimately the patch was rolled back.

As to the timing of the patch: Due to the super dense qualifier schedule happening around the world in the month leading up to the First Strike main event, we had few dates that could both avoid being disruptive to qualifiers and provide the runway of four weeks for Icebox. We erred on the side of releasing patch 1.11 before most of the qualifiers kicked off, but it ended up not quite stretching to account for the NA Qualifiers. We considered it painful but ‘okay,’ given all of the constraints we were working with (and shared patch notes early to those competitors). Smash cut to today, and I think we’re dealing with the worst-case scenario of disruption.

Anyway, to avoid having the first NA Qualifier played on two different patches, we’ve unlocked a separate instance where the remaining 16 teams will conclude the tournament on patch 1.10. In the meantime, the live game was updated to patch 1.11 on Nov. 2. These are definitely some growing lessons we’re learning as we stand up the esport scene and game at the same time.

—Riley Yurk, Manager, VALORANT Esports Strategy

Q

I know you now have Forced Name Change to punish players who violate the Code of Conduct with an offensive name, but what about dealing with the awful stuff in the chat?

A

We knew that chat would be a problem before launch and our new systems weren't going to be ready, so while we worked on finishing that, we put an interim system in place that has been running since launch.

Today we issued chat and voice comms restrictions to the worst of the worst, focusing on language and behavior that’s so obviously bad that it’s easy to detect. We’ve recently deployed a new chat evaluation system that is running in English, which means you might run into more players who’ve received text or voice restrictions. Over the upcoming months, we’re expanding our supported languages and improving our detection so it does more than catch only the most egregious offenders.

It’s important to remember that your words have a meaningful impact on your teammates, and what you say in the confines of a match can have lasting effects on the people you’ve said it to. Hate speech, slurs, and any type of threat or bullying is not welcome in our games. Players that receive chat restrictions are reminded to use in-game comms constructively—we win and lose together!

For the rest of you: Keep reporting players who aren’t following the Code of Conduct. Each report is sent into our behavior systems to review, and having the reports helps us continue to improve our machine learning models and get better & better at dealing with disruptive behavior.
This week’s Ask VALORANT covers weekly challenges, filthy smurfs, and...wait, did you say “test server”?

Q

Thoughts on adding more weekly challenges?

A

The goal of weekly challenges was to provide a bulk source of XP progress and tie some playful texture to the progression experience. To be frank, we're not happy with the current state, as some of them can be a grind. It's also been difficult to strike the right balance between interesting missions and not promoting unhealthy play patterns (eg. playing only to harvest orbs and use your ult).

Our short term outlook is to reduce the completion requirement for many weeklies in Act III and remove the worst offenders completely. So hopefully these changes, along with the extended length of Act III, many more of you will progress further and faster into the Battlepass.

Long term, we want to revisit how to keep game-to-game progression engaging. It's still early, but we have a design that seems promising for further exploration.

—Naoise Creavan, Senior Production Manager

Q

Smurfing is inevitable in ranked games, but I’m curious what you’re doing to discourage smurfs in VALORANT?

A

Smurfing always sucks, especially when you have rank on the line. While it’s hard to stop smurfing entirely in a free-to-play game, we are taking action to combat it. Right now we have a behind-the-scenes system for Unrated as well as one that applies to Iron through Diamond ranked players. The latter tracks an individual’s performance and notices when a player makes a highly disproportionate impact in a game. We then quickly boost them to harder matches and higher ranks in Competitive.

We stop leveraging this system for Immortal+ players because there isn't a ton of room to smurf or play down when you are already near the top ranks. Longer term, we’re also looking at ways to further accelerate placing smurfs into appropriately skilled matches. But right now we are prioritizing some improvements to our core rank system and leaderboards ahead of that.

—Ian Fielding, Senior Producer

Q

Is VALORANT going to get a test server, like League has PBE?

A

Yes! We will be creating a selectively updated pre-release environment, or PBE, some time in the first half of 2021. Specific features/queues will be advertised or limited and patches will be targeted for a certain length of time in advance of going live.

For those that are familiar with the League of Legends PBE, this will serve a similar purpose. We hope to expand on what we have learned and provide an early access experience that does not drastically differ from the live version of VALORANT, but still allows for a glimpse into what we are working on. This will also help us to gather more information so we can capture performance changes and expose bugs early that players might run into.
You should allow an in-game pause per team, because sometimes we have to pee or poop.

A

We've done some rough experimentation with team pauses in-game and pre-round. Pausing mid-round can introduce a number of gameplay concerns that may compromise the competitive integrity of a match. And since we view the competitive integrity of each match as a fundamental part of VALORANT, we've opted to not support mid-round pauses.

We know that sometimes you will need to “pee or poop,” as you so elegantly put it. To make sure everyone has a chance to handle their business, we'll be exploring different ways of possibly incorporating a pre-round pause. This would allow you to pause the match without the possibility of impacting the outcome of engagements.

It'd be rude of us to ask you to hold it while we plan out the details, so you should probably just go to the restroom now while we work this out.

—Steven Eldredge, Senior Producer

Q

Will we ever get a system to share crosshair settings, like the deck system code in Legends of Runeterra?

A

We definitely have plans for more crosshair customization in the future, and a good extension of that feature is to allow you to share your customizations with teammates and friends. I mean sharing is caring after all, right?

—Steven Eldredge, Senior Producer

Q

Will we ever be able to play on the practice range while queueing?

A

The tech is feasible to let you jump into the practice range while queuing, but we’ve been reluctant to pursue this because it is straight up not efficient for what it’s accomplishing and we’re more excited about alternatives, like an aim trainer you could access while in queue.

Here’s why: A practice range “match” is currently  just as expensive for us to run on the server side as a standard 5v5 match, but the effort is about 10x less efficient per player because it is only serving one player at a time. We prefer to preserve our server horsepower for bread and butter competitive matches.

Now about those alternatives. I mentioned a possible simple aim trainer that can scratch the trigger itch, and that could be a step to a future solution where you queue for something like FFA Deathmatch.  There is a bunch of prerequisite tech we need to figure out there before we could do something like this, but an early step we are taking toward this is to implement the ability to join FFA DM games in progress—which we hope to get done early next year.
Are there any updates regarding a “Left Hand View model”?

We know that this is something that a lot of players have been asking for and we've been doing some exploration into this. We're currently in the process of validating how this would work from not just a technical side but from a competitive and artistic front as well. While this may seem like a small technical challenge, we want to make sure this is done right for players. To do this we need to validate a couple of different things:

The first thing we want to consider is how we maintain the art fidelity of our awesome weapon skins, character models, and abilities. We don't frequently get to see different camera views of our first person weapons and viewarms so we'll need to make sure our art still holds up when we switch hands for players. We'll need to make sure that abilities still originate from the same place and that our hot fire still looks like... well... hot fire.

The second aspect we need to consider is how this might impact the competitive integrity of the game. We want to ensure that there are no advantages or disadvantages to playing with a left handed view model and that we maintain a fair competitive playing field. We want to make sure that left hand view isn't the new meta or that players with this preference aren't nerfed.

While this is something on our radar, we still need to ensure that we meet the criteria mentioned above and to do so we'll need to put these changes through rigorous competitive and artistic testing. With all that in mind, we unfortunately don't have a date we can share for when we think this will be available to players.

—Steven Eldredge, Senior Producer

Q

Are you open to updating existing skins, like adding effects for Spline?

We’re open to it! We’ve stated before that we’re potentially open to adding Variants to melees, so it’s not out of the question for us to update an existing skin line. It all comes down to how much players want it, how much work it is, and what things we don’t make as a result (weighing the trade offs). We’ve done little stealth updates that are pretty fast, like changing the gun buddy mount colors on the Agent skins. But going back to add effects to a skin line like Spline is definitely not fast or easy!

So, as of right now, we don't have plans to add feature-based upgrades (like VFX, new animations, or audio) to existing skins. Before we take on something like this, we want to make sure we're making changes players actually want, and that what we're doing is sustainable. That requires more research and testing, which takes time and resources to complete. So even if we did decide to pursue this, players probably wouldn't see it for a while. Going back to work on something we’ve already released means that we aren’t working on the next awesome thing that you’re all waiting for. This is a trade off we don’t take lightly, because ultimately we want to prioritize the content you all want most.

—Sean Marino, Art Lead, and Preeti Khanolkar, Producer

Q

Will the map rotation changes in patch 1.08 result in longer queue times?

These changes will not impact queue times! That's the main reason we didn't hard restrict players from getting the same map multiple times in a row, but instead made it so we significantly reduce the chance of that occurrence. This way, we maintain a little bit of flexibility to keep queue times popping at the same pace.

—Ian Fielding, Senior Producer

Q

This is probably frustrating to hear but: it feels like my experience with VAL on a game-to-game basis is inconsistent, like sometimes I'll have problems landing basic shots but other times everything will feel buttery smooth. I'm not trying to make excuses for my own performance, but something just doesn't always feel right. Do you feel this or see it? Are you investigating?

We’re not dodging this, but understanding what’s going on has been a real hoot. I’ll also say it’s not just you: we’re constantly pulse-checking where players are at on the “reliability and consistency of combat” though surveys, gameplay analytics, and yes, social media (hi, Reddit). Over the past couple months, we noticed some less than inspiring trends on perceptions of shooting reliability (namely, declining positive sentiment around “My bullets reliably hit targets when I expect them to”), so that prompted us to dig deeper.

As I bring up what some players are saying, keep in mind there is a team on VALORANT that is chasing down issues with hit registration and clarity, and they've shipped changes throughout VALORANT's existence so far. But for things like "VALORANT feels different game to game," it can be hard to nail down exactly what that means. For these types of situations, we like to sit down with players (in this case, ranging from Gold to Immortal+) to hear in their own words what's going on.

In our conversations, these players said (broadly) that shooting felt reliable and consistent the vast majority of the time—however, there was also clear room for improvement. They highlighted these opportunities for improving reliability in combat: increasing hitbox clarity, improving readability and predictability of states of movement inaccuracy, and minimizing the difference in gameplay feel across different ping conditions. Those sound like good spaces to investigate, so we are!

We’re now in the process of digging into each one of these, while also trying to build a more holistic picture of gameplay reliability—one that blends player sentiment, gameplay analytics, and a deep technical analysis of our underlying systems. Ensuring the game respects you and your opponents’ skill is critical to delivering on the promise of VALORANT, and we won’t be setting this to the side any time soon. Keep the feedback coming, and we’ll keep on digging.
I understand it means I’m doing something right, but what exactly does it mean when I have stars in my performance history?

A

If you’ve ever received a gold or silver sticker in your life for doing well, then this system likely speaks to you. In the performance tab, a star indicates if you’ve played better than we anticipated. That is, if you were regularly beating someone in combat and/or closely competing with someone of a higher rank than you, expect to have that acknowledged via a star.

A silver star means you exceeded expectations and a gold star means you’ve really punched above your weight. Pat on the back not included.

—Ian Fielding, Senior Producer

Q

Is it true that there’s an extra importance on frags when it comes to getting a good combat score? If so, do you plan on increasing the recognition of assists and other forms of contributions to your team (spotting or slowing enemies, healing allies, etc)?

A

Your combat score is not just based on kills, although that is a big factor in the score. We also look at damage inflicted, meaning that assists where you help kill an enemy are taken into account, as well as utility that does damage.There are some other factors that help inform your combat score, such as first bloods and streaks. These are called out on the combat score tool tip. Longer term, we are looking into ways to incorporate non-damaging assists into your combat score as well.

Regarding competitive, while your combat score indicates how well you performed in core combat during the game, it’s not 1:1 with the performance calculations we use for your rank updates. Rank updates leverage some, not only, of these data points. Simply put, the focus of whether or not your rank updates is primarily focused on wins and the decisiveness of these wins.

—Ian Fielding, Senior Producer

Q

I'm really interested in getting a specific weapon skin variant but it feels bad to have to get a variant I’m not interested in so I can unlock the one I want. Will I ever be able to buy a variant directly?

A

Yes! Starting with Patch 1.10 players will be able to select any variant they want. Weapon skins will still need to be fully evolved to unlock variants, but after doing so, you’ll be able to pick whichever one is most appealing to you.

—Miles "Riot Usury" Metzger, Revenue Strategist

Q

Why don’t any of the melee skins have variants? I think this could look really good, especially on Sovereign and Spline. The melee skins cost more than regular skins but they don't have variants. Personally, I would love to have a green Spline dagger and don't see why we can't.

A

"We've read the frequent posts asking a version of this question and it's definitely something we'd like to have in VALORANT too. So for one of our upcoming skin lines, we're going to test out variants on melee weapons. Consider it a limited test to see whether this is something desired by enough players for our small team to commit to. We'll evaluate and determine what is needed from our end to pursue variants on future melees, if it's something that players really want."

—Sean Marino, Art Lead, and Preeti Khanolkar, Producer

Q

About that audio question last time...can you just tell us if HRTF is coming?

A

First—sorry if it seemed like my original response came across as "we know better!" or that we didn't hear you in wanting HRTF. I just wanted to explain our limitations and challenges we wanted to solve, rather than making it seem like they were more important than your requests. Second, I'll say that we agree that HRTF is a worthwhile endeavor, and plan to begin work on implementation. There are a few preemptive steps we need to take (e.g. engine version updates), but are hoping that we can start in October.
What are your thoughts on the opinion that “the Operator is too OP”?

A

We think the Operator isn't "too OP" but do believe that the feeling sometimes comes from a lack of personal agency against the weapon (for Agents that don't have tools to break line of sight for themselves), coupled with an overwhelming amount of team coordination to effectively counter an Operator. We're looking into a lot of avenues to help smooth out the experience but we do believe the Operator should be powerful and should encourage a team to thoughtfully enter a space where it might be in play.

To give an anecdote: we've tried iterations of the game where the Operator's strengths weren't as sharp as they are today (especially in holding defensive angles). We discovered that without moments where a team was forced to sit down and plan how to play against (or around) a good Operator, a lot of gameplay became about who could rush faster.

The Operator—like all weapons, maps, Agents, etc.—is a part of our continuous holistic review of the state of the game, and we’ll make changes in the future if we feel it’s needed. No changes now doesn’t mean no changes ever.

Q

Why do EU/CIS/TR regions get patches and features later than everyone else (like Deathmatch)? Why can’t you just turn things on for everyone at the same time?

A

[Editor’s note: For anyone who wasn’t aware, when we ship major patches, we typically patch in 3 regional chunks. The NA/LATAM/BR regional cluster first, then the KR/JP/SEA/OCE regional cluster, then the EU/TR/CIS regional cluster last.]

There are two things we consider when we select the time to ship new content: server stability and game stability. For server stability, if there’s high demand for a new feature (as there was with deathmatch), we see massive amounts of players logging in simultaneously to play. If we launch a high-demand feature on top of peak login time (typically around 4-7pm anywhere), we’re deliberately DDoSing our servers by creating the largest possible spike of logins. This is why we try to ship ‘off’ peak playtime (which we know is a little frustrating for people who want to play when they get back from school or work). This lets us spread out logins for those who just want to play a game normally vs. those who want to try new content as soon as possible. This might not explain why the EU/TR/CIS regional cluster goes last, but it does highlight why we don’t like to ship highly anticipated patches everywhere at the same time: it’s always peak play time somewhere in the world.

Game stability is the main reason EU/CIS/TR regions typically get big, complicated patches last. We want to make sure if we do hit a critical game-breaking bug, we don’t have to hotfix it across every region simultaneously. EU/CIS/TR regions tend to get more stable patches of all 3 clusters because we can quickly integrate hotfixes before the main patch goes out, rather than having to triage it while it’s already out there. EU/CIS/TR also happens to be the largest population of VALORANT players, so major disruptions have an objectively bigger impact.

Finally, if it makes sense that we need to ship patches ‘off’ peak hours in every region and we want to be able to put in hotfixes before the next region gets a patch (if necessary), then the last consideration is that we’re a Los Angeles-based developer. We try to make sure we ship all patches across a single day (in Pacific Standard Time), because if we have to wait overnight (or work overnight), we’ll have less developers available to fix things at any time. So we start patches as soon as we get into the office (off peak hours, so we can’t start with the EU/TR/CIS regional cluster because EU is right at peak play time), and try to ship our last patch before the end of the night.

This is a long explanation, but hopefully it highlights that we’re not playing favorites.

Q

Sometimes it feels like sound is off in the game, like footsteps are much closer than they really are, or I hear them in the wrong direction! Am I going crazy? Does VALORANT do something different with sound?

The footstep radius is set up to give players who hear enemy footsteps time to use an ability and re-equip a weapon before they are in danger.

I've also heard feedback around the fact that people have a hard time telling how far away a footstep is, which there is truth to. We optimize for making sure footsteps are heard, as opposed to optimizing for portraying distance. What this looks like is an attenuation curve that is somewhat flat, versus one that drops off a lot over distance. There are a couple reasons we do this. One is that under chaotic conditions where abilities are being used and you are probably hearing a lot of VOIP from your team, it is essential that you don't miss a footstep.

Based on internal playtests, not hearing a footstep and getting killed by someone you knew had to run to get to you is very tilting. This feels especially bad for players who have internalized rotation times on the map and have good communication and callouts on their team.

We also know our game will be played in a variety of contexts. NA players may be used to playing in a quiet room and hearing every detail, but players in China or Korea may be playing in a loud PC Bang, where a footstep that was quiet but gave more information on distance would be lost. I have never played professionally, but I imagine clarity would also be appreciated for esports players who may be in a noisy stadium (hopefully someday!)

Another reason for this is that we don't want to give players the incentive to turn their volume up to painful levels because they have to listen for faint audio cues to be competitive, or to add external DSP to compress their audio (which happens for some other FPS games.) If the game designers want you to have the information, we want you to clearly have the information.

While there's a drawback from having the attenuation curve flatter, I think the advantages are more important.

As far as panning direction goes, we have heard reports of this both internally and on live. When our design playtest has investigated this in the past using videos of multiple viewpoints, the panning has turned out to be correct.

We currently mix the game in stereo, meaning there is no difference between a sound 45 degrees to your left in front of you and a sound 45 degrees to your left in back of you. Some people expect to be able to hear this difference, but that is not currently possible.

Also, engaging the “7.1” mode on various headphones does not help. There is no way for the headphones to decode our stereo sound into 7.1 and may even make spatialization much worse!
I heard someone at Riot once say that “abilities don’t kill” in VALORANT, but... there are clearly ones that do, like Raze. Are you breaking your promise?
A

This statement isn't completely accurate—especially in a game that already had Raze and Killjoy's gameplay locked in before our announcement... Anyway, that was our mistake—a big part of that mistake was in missing the nuance (specifically that tactical fundamentals—not just “abilities don't kill”—are a key component).

Guns provide the vast majority of kills, and even our damage abilities are designed with the goal of creating threat. When well-played against, guns should be the primary method used to finish off opponents that are preoccupied with a distraction, or trying to avoid the damage. In cases where that isn't holding up—like mid-combat Blast Pack usage—we'll fix those as part of our ongoing commitment to tactical gameplay.

If this promise (abilities never kill) was the thing that made you come to try VALORANT, we're sorry if we misled you, even unintentionally. But our position is, and has been, that abilities that deal damage are a core part of tactical games—whether it be VALORANT or other tac shooters. We can unpack this topic more in the future if you’re interested!

Q
Are there any abilities or kits that are a no-go in VALORANT? How far is too far for?
A

Specifically, we try to avoid abilities that would remove the high-consequence gunplay. Increased maximum health tends to be a no-fly zone, as do abilities that replace guns (that aren't an ultimate, like Jett or Raze).

Q
Hi anti-cheat team! We haven’t heard much from you these days, just wondering how things are going. Can you tell us how many cheaters you’ve banned so far?
A

Hi! We've been toiling away in the anti-cheat mines but we've missed talking to you all.

So far we've banned a bunch of cheaters (and their computers) from the game, and have generally tried to keep the miscreants out. We can always do better, but I think we're doing well overall.

I don't have a total number of bans to share but I didn't want you to leave empty handed so I brought something for you number fans out there: 1802

That's the number of manual bans the anti-cheat team has issued after investigating suspicious players. While the overwhelming majority of bans are automatically applied by Vanguard, me and the rest of the team manually review suspicious accounts. This helps us find previously unknown cheats and also lets us evaluate Vanguard's performance. It also gives us an opportunity to manually accelerate the ban for the most disruptive players.

What’s that like? Personally, I like to start my day with coffee and a list of suspicious players sorted by most reported. I start drinking my coffee and go through the list manually reviewing accounts until I've had enough. Coffee, not reviewing. And I really like coffee, which is probably why I am currently top of the team leaderboard for most accounts reviewed. I doubt I'll hold the position for long though because we've recently expanded the pool of people investigating—so I have a lot more competition.
Have you considered an option to disable the special animations / sound effects of gun skins? While the aesthetics of the skins are pretty nice, all the effects around them can be distracting.



A

Yes, we discussed this a lot before launch. There are a few things that we had to consider first before we started building any tech to support something like this, including how players would react to custom effects, animation, and sound.

First of all, we’re committed to fixing anything that compromises the competitive integrity of the game. If it’s objectively interfering with our players’ gameplay, we’ll fix it (like we did for the equip animation and sound priority on the Elderflame Operator). We try to build all of our skins so that they aren't something that players will want to turn off, but we realize that players will always have different tastes. For example, when the Oni skins released, we had lots of players tell us to turn up the audio because they couldn't hear the subtle ghostly sounds in the middle of combat. And, of course, many other players begged us to keep the volume as it is because it was perfect for them.

In terms of the feasibility of turning off different skin elements individually, the possibilities become infinitely complicated. What if I want animations but not the effects? How does that look? Or I don't want the audio, but I want the animations and/or effects? If we played the base audio, it wouldn't sync up to the animations anymore. With so many possible combinations, we can't feasibly ensure a quality, cohesive experience for players. And that's not something we want to compromise.

What is more feasible is enabling the option for a player to toggle between all the levels of a skin they own. This way, if you own a Level 4 Elderflame Operator, you can still toggle down to Levels 1-3, rather than being stuck only using Level 4. A system like this takes time to build and means that the engineers working on it aren't tackling other equally important gameplay needs. All that said, we recognize the value in Skin Level Toggling, and it's something we want to invest in.

Q

When do we get more lore?



A

Are you asking why a chunk of Italy is in the sky? If it can go twice as high? You'll start to understand more as things unfold, but Italy rising into the air is the inciting event for the conflict of VALORANT.

We've always believed that art, creative, and story should serve competitive gameplay first. Now, this doesn't mean we can't tell stories in the world of VALORANT, but that we should pursue other methods—hints and connections buried within the game—while building on a foundational universe that we may never fully explain. We hope you'll join us!

Q

Would you consider the option to create custom keybinds for each Agent?



A

Agent-specific keybinds are very high on our priority list and we've already started work on the feature. Exact patch timing is still unknown, but it's something we want to deliver to players ASAP.

—Jason Falcone, Principal UX Designer

Q

A while back there was a "known issue" with crouching and hitboxes. I was wondering if you fixed it, because sometimes I still see headshots register as body shots?



A

Short answer: Yes, we found and fixed a hit registration bug caused by crouch synchronization in a previous patch.

Long answer: We don't believe there are any major issues with hit registration correctness currently in VALORANT. However, we understand that visual clarity on the result of a shot (particularly in the crouching case) isn't always the best. In this specific example, it’s confusing because a player can crouch their head behind a body shot particle effect, making it look like a headshot.

We're currently iterating on ways to improve readability in this and other scenarios. We're aiming to share an article soon that takes a closer look at the state of hit reg and what we're working on improving, so stay tuned!
Will VALORANT have a gifting system like League has?

A

Yes, gifting will be coming to VALORANT (soon™)! We want to give players the ability to gift content as a way of celebrating victories, holidays, or any occasion that calls for it. We're aiming to enable gifting by the end of 2020, but timelines may shift as we get closer to the date.

—Miles "Riot Usury" Metzger, Revenue Strategist

Q

Is VALORANT going to get an in-game replay system?

A

Yes! this is something that we're interested in exploring soon. Whether it's to study previous matches for tactical advantages or to create spicy memes, we know that players will find a wide range of interesting uses for a system like this.

—Steven Eldredge, Senior Producer

Q

Will there be a map select/playlist option?

A

From a Competitive perspective, we really want to ensure we’re able to not only put players in fair matches but do so in a reasonable queue time. Splitting up matchmaking into separate map pools would reduce the overall players in our matchmaking pool, which not only slows down matchmaking, but makes it more difficult for us to produce fair matches. Given that, we currently don't have plans to enable map specific selection for Matchmaking.

—Ian Fielding, Senior Producer

Q

What does VAL want out of their observing client as it relates to esports?

A

We know the esports observer tool currently in VALORANT is a little bare-bones, but it’s something that we’ll be building together in the coming while. We’re taking notes from each set of Ignition series tournaments (happening every weekend!) and getting active input from organizers, spectators, and audience members so we make sure we prioritize the right tools.

Long-term, the observer client is a tool to enable storytelling and to capture the action and style of the game played at the highest level—everything we love about VALORANT from an esports perspective. We believe VALORANT has the potential to be a sport watched and enjoyed by gamers everywhere, but in order for that promise to be realized, we have to craft a viewing experience like no other, and the foundation for that is with the observer client.

We know the game has complexities that add a lot of context to what's happening in a match. Things like Agent locations, what abilities haven't been used, what weapons everyone’s purchased, and so on, are very important in telling a competitive narrative. We want to ensure the observer client can support an entertaining broadcast, both for players that are familiar with VALORANT and those that may be watching it for the first time.

This is a necessary tool that unlocks a broadcast team’s ability to craft amazing viewer experiences. However, it's not just building a great observer client but ensuring there's easy access to real-time data that unlocks a bunch of features and experiences at the broadcast level, as well as experiences like fantasy sports adjacent to the broadcast.

We'll need to build not just the tools you see available today but also dream up what more could be done to unlock broadcast teams in the community and at Riot. We'll have more to share on this in the coming months.

Q

How many Radiant-tier players are there in the world?

A

We’ve designed Radiant to represent the most elite players, with anywhere from 20 to 150 players having earned the rank per region, depending on player population size. Earning the Radiant rank is meant to be challenging and a significant achievement for VALORANT players. You also have to remain as an active player to stay in Radiant, if you haven't played in 14 days, you will have to re-earn it.
Do you have any plans to change the aim punch? Like, each weapon getting a different amount of aim punch?

A

Not at the moment, but I do think there’s an opportunity to lessen aim punch in extreme cases, for example, a long fire from a pistol or shotgun that is inflicting minimal damage with lots of fall off.

—Trevor Romleski, Senior Game Designer

Q

Many of us are wondering, will there be a deathmatch mode?

A

Deathmatch is absolutely a mode that is coming to VALORANT in the future. We don't have a timetable yet, but it's something where we're actively working on the underlying technology as well as designing, iterating, prototyping, and playtesting right now.

—Jared Berbach, Lead Game Modes Producer

Q

Are there any plans to make the VALORANT client a non-full screen application?

A

"There are no plans at the moment for menus to have their own display mode setting like the League Client where it launches an executable ‘game’ in full-screen from a news/store/friendlist client. This is mostly due to the fact that VALORANT is an all-in-one executable, whereas League’s is two separate ones. Players can currently put the game into windowed and windowed fullscreen which will also apply to their in-game experience.”

—Steven Eldredge, Senior Producer

Q

Will there be a pick and ban system with Agents and maps?

A

We've considered a draft phase for agents, but the current thinking is that we would not have bans. For some more reasoning around bans: first, we expect teams to have set plays and strategies that will require very specific agents. Banning an agent would invalidate that entire strategy, and we don’t want to discourage practice.

Second, bans often remove a players’ star agent and we want players who are exceptional at certain agents to be able to play them and show off their skills with them. Finally, because VALORANT doesn’t have hard counters in the form of agents (this isn’t our design philosophy), we think the game state is healthier if we’re held accountable to ensuring no agent or agent-facilitated strategy becomes so oppressive or unsolvable that a ban is the only choice.

—Trevor Romleski, Senior Game Designer

Q

Will it be possible to play in other regions? Example, playing on NA servers while being on EU?

A

While we know that some friendships can be easily sustained across thousands of miles, a fast internet connection can’t. All games of VALORANT must be hosted on a single game server located in a single physical location, so even if we allow someone in Japan to queue up with someone in the UK (for example), one of them has to connect to a game server that’s very, very far away. This also means that 8 other players in the game will have to play with someone with a bad connection—and they didn’t sign up for that! We’re going to keep an eye on demand here, but for a game as precise and demanding as VALORANT, we have to focus on keeping all matches fair.
Why can't I earn VALORANT Points in the Battlepass instead of Radianite points?



A

“I sense two separate questions here—why you can’t earn VP and why we give out Radianite Points in the battle pass— I’ll break them out.

So first, why can’t you earn VP in the battle pass? Our goal is that when you buy a battle pass, you buy it for the total value of it rather than buying it as a way of getting enough currency to buy the next one. We want the battle pass to be the highest value product we offer as well as a compelling experience, but by adding VP as an incentive we hurt our ability to fund our long-term vision for the battle pass. We'll be doing more studying on the current battle pass to make sure that you feel like it offers great value and will continue to make sure that the content within it justifies the price.

Now the second question: long-term, what are Radianite points for? Our plan is to have Radianite Points become the evolving currency of VALORANT. So as we develop new features, we hope you'll be able to use it to buy more Gun Buddies, upgrade Player Cards and Sprays in addition to what is currently just weapon skins. We'll make sure to offer ways to spend your Radianite Points on content that is unlocked within the battle pass. It’ll take us some time to get there but that's our long-term vision for the product.”

—Joe Lee, Revenue Lead

Q

Some unrated games have felt really unbalanced, is it because unrated has looser matchmaking?



A

"Our goal with Unrated Mode is to allow players a way to play the core VALORANT game mode with any of their friends. Given this, it means there is going to be a wider range of skills in games, and that can lead to matches feeling less fair. We still have strategies to make sure we keep stomps low and matches competitive, but Unrated will generally have a slightly higher range of skills. We have taken some steps at the cost of a moderate increase to queue times in order to reduce the average disparity in matches. We hope this leads to matches feeling more balanced.

Comparing Competitive and Unrated, we actually have a pretty similar matchmaking configuration, with the biggest difference being that in Unrated, there’s no limitation on who you can party up with skill-wise. As it turns out, lots of folks have friends of varying degrees of skill they'd like to play with!

Right now, the majority of our Unrated matches are still within the skill disparity constraints that Ranked games would allow. For the high skill disparity matches, the skill gaps come directly from the premade, while the matchmaker adds zero or very limited skill disparity to the match. We are working on launching our Competitive mode in patch 1.02, which hopefully will help players in both queues, and Competitive will continue to have hard limits on skill disparity.

As a final note, we do track matchmaking ‘quality’ in many ways, including match balance (the final round score) and skill disparity (the difference in skill between the best and worst player in a match), and so far haven’t found huge balance issues, but we’ll continue to monitor this data at scale."

Q

Will there ever be new guns introduced to VALORANT? Ever is a kinda long time, maybe, are there short-term plans to introduce new guns?



A

“This quote from the article on the VALORANT arsenal sums it up nicely: ‘No weapon should feel like it only exists to troll, or have no imagined use scenario. Likewise, guns that felt redundant were also removed.’

There are no immediate short term plans to add new guns. We've had the current 17 guns in the game for some time now (internally) and feel that the balance is in a good spot as of today. And as noted in the article, we removed some guns along the way in early development if we felt they were redundant or didn't serve a clear purpose.

We'll learn a lot more about the gun balance through the many players playing our game, so I'm sure we'll discover potential gaps in the arsenal we could fill in the coming months.Adding a new gun isn't totally out of the question, but it's also not something we're planning for the short term.”
Hey VALORANT sharpshooters, I’m VALORANT Art Lead Sean Marino here to talk about everyone’s favorite topic: the guns! Specifically, discussing what defines a VALORANT weapon and how we brought these principles to life in the game. First, let's start with this quote from Trevor Romleski, lead game designer.

“BULLETS STILL KILL WIZARDS”

This phrase was something that we latched onto early to help define the gameplay pillars and visuals of the VALORANT weapons. It was the foundation for how we would flesh them out within the game.

First came a pledge to uphold certain standards of the genre. With a tactical shooter, there are expectations around gameplay and weapons that we strived to sustain, regardless of what the VALORANT IP would become.

Then we cemented a “gameplay first” approach. Let’s create a gun for every situation. There should not be an overpowered or “best” weapon in the arsenal. It should be all about trade-offs between power and economy. No weapon should feel like it only exists to troll, or have no imagined use scenario. Likewise, guns that felt redundant were also removed (ask us about the Otto!)

CORE WEAPON PILLARS
Vandal-Concept.jpg
Very early we tried an approach where every weapon had to be more radically different than the last, in terms of art, functionality, etc. But we had lots of weapons to build and this was not sustainable. Out of this trial, we came to these four weapon pillars:

GROUNDED/IDENTIFIABLE
Players should be able to look at a VALORANT weapon and make a connection to what may have inspired it—either visually from the real world, or gameplay-wise from games within similar genres.

BALLISTIC/LETHAL
Bullets. No lasers. No “pew pew.” Yes, gameplay has to be taken into account for balance in terms of damage and such, but ultimately, audio, muzzle flashes, and animations need to reflect a tool that delivers bullets into objects.

TACTICAL
As it relates to weapon animation, the player’s interaction with the weapons are meant to depict intention and precision. Picture how a professional knows their way around a weapon—reloading, handling, etc., every movement reflects thousands of hours of training.

COHESIVE
The origins of our weapons can be traced. That is, we avoided creating mixed “factions” that would show disparate design languages. This was an early decision to not have “A vs B” sided gun designs for VALORANT.

DESIGN PROCESS
Frenzy_evolution_r1.jpg
ART
We began each weapon’s visual design by creating a mashup of guns that fit the gameplay, and made sure to callout key identifiable features that separated each gun from the others. Simply put, players should be able to look at the full arsenal and not confuse one gun for another.

In both first-person and third-person perspective, there should be a unique visual marker per weapon that tells the player immediately what it is. This includes something as basic as the silhouette shape, or smaller details like magazine placement or charging handles.

ANIMATION
Similar to what we discovered early on by trying to reinvent the wheel with weapon identity, we realized we slightly overcorrected and swung too far in the opposite direction. This led us to create animations—and associated audio cues—that are both recognizable and learnable.

Sean McSheehan, lead weapon animator, helped design each weapon to have its own recognizable “beat” pattern. Some weapon equip animations have a two or three-beat step for reloads, for example. It’s case-by-case, but something players can watch out for. See, but also listen. These beats indicate to a player what state their gun is in, and when it is ready to fire.

VFX
muzzle-flash-concepts.jpg
In the same vein as weapons, lead weapon VFX Artist, Stefan Jevremovic, wanted to include a visual differentiation for effects like muzzle flashes in both first-person and third-person perspective—sort of like a language dialect for each that reflects the shape, use, and power of the weapon.

AUDIO
VALORANT is a game of angles. With the help of VALORANT Audio Director Peter Zinda and Sound Designer Isaac Kikawa, we recorded weapon audio so that their third-person perspective sounds change based on their direction of fire. Simply, guns give off a different sound based on whether they are firing toward you, to your side, or away from you.

How did we do this? Well, if we’re using the real world as inspiration, you know we had to include the obligatory audio capture sessions to gather as many sounds as we could for each. Hammer strikes the firing pin? That’s a capture. Magazine releases? That’s a capture. You get the idea.

We also used Riot's foley stage to capture all the surface based sounds, like footsteps, bodyfalls, shells dropping, magazines dropping, etc. We wanted to make sure they sounded consistent, because recognizing sounds on surfaces provides clues to the direction of the noisemaker.

REFINING GAMEPLAY
ATTACHMENT SYSTEM
Some weapons were designed to have an attachment, such as silencers, scopes, and such. For this, some of our team members felt it might be an interesting system if we allowed attachments on any weapon.

But after many rounds of testing, we found that certain guns had “preferable” or best-in-slot attachments, and players never really changed them once they found the ones that yielded the best gameplay results. That’s when we decided to take the stat benefits from those and just bake it directly into the weapon.

Voilà, now the Ghost has a silencer.

Speaking of which, Silencers were the last baked-in attachment we made. Not only do they allow for further visual differentiation between weapons, they include some gameplay benefits. Silencers give a weapon's firing sounds a smaller attenuation than the other guns, unless they are firing toward the listener, in which case they are audible at any range. This prevents situations where players could be killed by a gun they didn't hear, but also gives silencer users some information denial.

Another example. There’s a meaningful differentiation between the Vandal and the Phantom, which helps one not be the definitive "better" of the other and is instead based on gameplay decisions. In other words: it depends on what you want. Like shooting through smokes? Buy a Phantom. Prefer to one-tap at a distance? Vandal is your friend.

ADS CONTENTION
A fairly large point of contention on the team was whether we would allow for aiming down sights, or ADS, with our attachments. In modern shooters, this is a common and mostly expected thing, but in traditional tac shooters this was not.

Trust us, many post-team dinner chats were dedicated to the value of ADS. We left as friends but there were clear "ADS" vs. "hip fire only" divides in some cases. Obviously, we had to solve this, not just to accommodate different shooter players, but find a solution that didn't disappoint advocates on either side.

The solve was done in two parts: One, allow for players to opt into an ADS playstyle if they chose, providing no clear gameplay advantage over hip-fire like you may see in other games. Two, we would keep the attachment design minimal, so that it did not interfere with the visual real estate of the weapon.

We also found that adding big “red dot” or ACOG-like attachments made the guns feel bulkier, and ultimately covered more area of the screen during hip fire, making it feel disadvantageous to the shooter. Our first “tech” attachment was born, a red dot that projected a holographic sight picture. While not quite a grounded-in-reality type device, we felt like we were far enough along with the VALORANT IP to know how technology would organically manifest, and this sort of gadget attachment felt like an appropriate compromise for our visual as well as gameplay concerns.
Hey, VALORANT! I’m Preeti Khanolkar (Producer), and I’m here to talk to you about how we bring weapon skin fantasies to life while staying within the boundaries of VALORANT’s competitive integrity. Together, Sean Marino (Art Lead) and I run the Premium Content team, which is responsible for all the cosmetics you see in the game: weapons skins, gun buddies, sprays, and more. But today, we’d like to focus just on weapon skins!

Last week, Marino outlined our principles for weapons: A gameplay-first approach with a gun for every situation. And that’s not changing, even when your Vandal spits molten fire or blasts sleek sci-fi energy. Our goal for skins is to give players another way to express who they are and what they love without ruining another player’s gameplay experience.

We'd like to give you a behind-the-scenes peek at how we work so you can see how we design skins not just for personalized expression, but for appreciation—to immerse you in your chosen fantasy. And if you want to dive even deeper into your skin’s fantasy, we’ve created evolutionary tracks for several skins that add custom anims, effects, audio, and more to strike the right emotions and feeling—your fit, your choice.

Our rules:

A skin’s model, art, visual effects, animations, and sounds are fully immersive in 1st-person only
Only a skin’s model is seen from another player’s perspective (3rd-person)
No pay-to-win. No pay-to-lose. Nope. Never.
If we find any skin that breaks these rules, it was accidental and we’ll fix it! Sorry, only some of us are robots—the rest of us make mistakes!
THE FIRST DROP OF INK
Alistar_Soul_Stealer_AK.jpg
A fresh coat of paint on your favorite weapon is great, but what more can we do to make you feel an alternate fantasy. And how far can we push it? This far? Yes. That far? No, stop it. That’s the balance we’re always looking to strike.

But before we fall in love with a skin idea, we ask ourselves how we’d execute something like that in VALORANT and whether or not that’s something players even want.

Who’s this for? We don’t make skins for us; we make them for you! That’s why our amazing research team combed through tons of player surveys and lab feedback to see what kinds of themes you want to see in VALORANT. For example, should we lean into traditional sci-fi, high fantasy, sleek modern aesthetics, or create something totally abstract?

PC_Brainstorming


Then the idea. Sometimes a random piece of art will grab us, or a quick sketch from a concept artist, or maybe we expand on something we’re already passionate about. The whiteboards covered in over 130-sticky notes prove no idea is too wild. We take inspiration from improv and always ask “yes, and?” (and never say “no, because”) when we’re in the earliest stages of brainstorming. Still, how do we distinguish between guns that get the "all-in" fantasy treatment and those that don't?

Five questions. A small group from our team—the ones who feel most passionate about the idea and are willing to fight for it—kicks off the ideation process. This is where we flesh out the vision based on the imagined world and desired fantasy. We found that answering a few questions at the outset helps our guide our thinking:

What are some adjectives to describe it?
What theme song sets the mood?
Is there a single key piece of art that captures the universe?
In this alternate universe, who’d use this weapon?
What materials is the weapon made of?
How do we want a player to feel when they use this weapon? What’s their mood?
What’s the “oh sh*t!” moment a player experiences the first time they see this skin?
Without answering these, we’re stuck in a place where we’re thinking “Is this a rock? Is it an alien? Is it futuristic technology? Or is it futuristic technology that aliens made out of rocks?” We don’t want to start making a skin line without clarity on what we’re actually trying to make. That’s why answers to these questions help align the team around a cohesive, unified vision that ties the whole experience together.

Simply, this helps us make better skins.

KICK IT TO THE TEAM
Soul_Stealer_Revolver.jpg
Concept and model

First, our talented concept artists take the team’s abstract (and sometimes insane) idea and references to create the skin’s first concept. Through some back-and-forth, they arrive at a final concept for the skin line.

The modeling process begins in earnest after we bring the concept to completion and agree that it hits the desired fantasy, is something we can actually create, as well as fits within our strict gameplay constraints. For example, we make sure that the skin model matches both the 1st-person and 3rd-person silhouette of the base weapon, and it’s recognizable when on the ground.

Animation

Animation on a skinned weapon should also mirror the beats of the base weapon. The goal here is that no skin makes a weapon feel unfamiliar. Using a new skin should never mean having to relearn a weapon: it should fire the same way, never feel slower (feeling faster is okay, but actually being faster is unacceptable), and it shouldn’t take up less (or more) space on your screen.

In extremely rare cases, we make an exception and break some of these rules if the fantasy absolutely requires it (you’ll see what we mean!). For example, maybe the skin takes up just a little bit more of your screen during the equip animation. But we only do this after lots of debate, tons of testing and iteration, and after we have explicit design approval. And as always, it’s never pay-to-win.

VFX


Your focus in VALORANT is to frag, plant or defuse the Spike, and take home the win with style. This should not change with weapon skins (except maybe some fun pre-round spamming and inspects). Thus, any visual effects tied to a weapon skin should look really awesome, but never distracting.

Weapons will keep their base muzzle flash shape and scale, bullet tracers can only be seen from the shooter’s 1st-person perspective, and aiming reticles will stay clean and easily readable when you ADS.

Audio

Audio is one of those things that really cements the entire fantasy of a skin, but it’s also one of the most important parts of VALORANT’s gameplay. We never want you to think you failed to clutch a round because a skin caused you to miss a critical sound cue.

This means that if new audio is part of a skin, we make sure it’s not any louder or quieter than the base version, but it still pops in a noticeable way. If you’re relying on audio for your spray control, we don’t want new firing sounds to mess with that.

We always make sure there's a sound paired with gameplay-relevant points in the animation, for example, when ammo is loaded into a gun. We do our best to maintain the timings of when these animations make sound, and when they go quiet.

If we're adding sounds during what are otherwise moments of silence in the base version, we do it to delight you and bring something awesome to the skin's theme. However, these purely cosmetic audio elements have their volume ducked by more important gameplay cues around you.

What does this mean? Let’s say you’re hiding behind the truck on Bind A site. You want to reload your Reaver Vandal, but you’re worried that the ghostly reload sounds might block out the enemy Sova’s footsteps as he approaches the site from spawn to defuse. WORRY NOT! Go ahead and reload that Reaver Vandal, knowing that the right audio cues are always being prioritized.

DESIGN PLAYTESTS
Soul_Stealer_Kit_Concepts.jpg
We test everything, and we mean everything, with the team in our Design Playtests (DPT)—our twice-a-day playtest where designers experiment with all of our new features like maps, characters, and you guessed it, skins.

This is where the imagined skin fantasy and commitment to gameplay go through extra scrutiny. Every skin enters rounds of feedback to narrow in on the fantasy without pushing it so far that it violates our commitment to competitive integrity. The DPT crew are our harshest critics, and we love them for that. Here are some examples of helpful feedback we’ve received that helped us make our skins better:

“This was so distracting that it made me not want to buy the Phantom all game.”
“The run animation doesn’t feel as fast/fluid/responsive as the base run melee.”
“It doesn't feel like a Classic. The damage output I get doesn't match up to the sound/vfx that comes with it. I think it’s really cool, but it messes with me gameplay-wise a bit. It’s also a pretty large model."
Apart from DPT testing, we also identify “expert consultants” on the VALORANT team who love the aesthetic we’re hoping to hit. If we’re making a high fantasy skin, we want to make sure our most dedicated fantasy nerd who should like this skin actually likes it. And if they don’t like it, or think it could be better, we want to hear more.

DID WE DO IT RIGHT?
Ultimately, we’ll only know if we’ve made the right skin in the right way once you tell us. VALORANT is still in closed beta, so we’ll learn so much more once we’re actually a fully live, global game.

In the meantime, the glimmer of hope we get is when Sal Garozzo (Volcano) interrupts us at 9pm to tell us just how much he loved a certain special firey melee he used in DPT that evening.

If Sal likes it, maybe we’re on the right track.
Hi again everyone! I’m Chris Stone, a weapons artist on the VALORANT Premium Content team. I last wrote about how our team collaborated to build the tech behind the Spline skins. Now that both League of Legends crossover skins are in-game, the team wanted to share how we got Ruination and Sentinels set off the ground, as well as how we used this as an opportunity to develop new “materials” for VALORANT skins.

OUR NEW MATERIALS
Sentinels of Light is Riot's big summer event, bringing the “Ruined” and "Sentinel" thematics to each of our games. Although VALORANT doesn’t occupy the same space as League of Legends, it was a fun opportunity to bring the “Black Mist” that is taking over Runeterra to our weapons.

Bringing this theme to life offered an interesting challenge: How do we visualize the Black Mist within the crystal while preserving both the competitive integrity of the weapons and creating something that fits within our tight performance constraints?

I knew we had to create something that the League team (and you) would be excited for while also satisfying VALORANT players (like myself) who don't know the first thing about League.

Right away I worked with our team’s FX artist to learn about the signature shapes that make up the Black Mist effect. I was even able to utilize one of his textures for the custom material I was making, which in the end, saved time and made the gun skin feel more cohesive!

King_Phantom_Concept.jpg

Materials here refers to a custom shader built inside of Unreal Engine Material Graph. Through an interesting combination of some light math and 2D painted textures, an artist is able to create some unique special materials, like the Black Mist effect. We experiment with creating these custom materials when we feel that they will add a nice visual bump to our skins.

After studying the concept to understand how I wanted to translate it to the final 3D in-game model, I decided that having the Black Mist effect flowing inside of the crystal material would be a great thematic tie-in to the larger Ruination set, and would hopefully be really hype to look at too.

King_Crystal_Gif_Optimized_02.gif

SO FRESH, SO CLEAN
OK, going to get technical here for a sec.

One challenge when creating any new special material for our weapon skins is authoring it in a clean way so that other artists can take and use it for other gun skins in the line, or building on top of it for an entirely new skin. Pro tip: leaving comments in Unreal Engine material graphs is incredibly helpful when someone else has to take a look at your work—I highly encourage every artist to use them!

After I finished prototyping out the material, I spoke with the FX artist working on the FX smoke trails on the skin to see if he had any thoughts before I called it final. We worked together to make it so he could match the intensity of my custom material with the intensity of his visual FX during the equip and reload animation—two big beats when players can really admire the overall skin.

Speaking of keeping work clean, this effort helped us quickly prototype and make the “Relic Stone” on the Sentinels of Light skin!

SpecialMaterial_Skins.jpg

SENTINELS OF LIGHT
For the Sentinels of Light skins, our lead artist on the project was looking for a way to represent the Relic Stones (these hold the power to keep the Black Mist at bay). The desire was to build the powerful relic intol the SoL skins so that they could hypothetically fight off the “Ruination” running wild in the League universe. The other goal was to make it feel cracked, yet beautiful and powerful —think Forsaken vibes.

Let’s focus on the Vandal for now.

I managed to turn some extra free time into quickly prototyping a material based on the tech I created for the Ruination skins. My first pass was on the rough side, but it was enough to get the rest of the team excited about the concept.

The lead artist on SoL skins took my prototype and added enough awesome new features and textures to make it something that really stood out while still representing the Relic Stone and it’s lore. One of the big visual features added is the ability for the crystal to change states when the gun is fired and reloaded.

This was combined with the great work our outsource managers were already doing with the weapons. They worked directly with our external partner to help guide the other SoL skins from the 2D concept all the way to the final 3D models that you see in game. This tight collaboration between artists and outsource managers really helps to create a large volume of complex gun skins like this set!

Sol_Crystal_Gif_Optimized_02.gif

SPOT THE TECH IN K/TAC
As a Senior Artist on VALORANT, I try to have a holistic view on the quality of weapon skins and search for opportunities where we can level them up, so to speak.

The K/TAC skins are an example of extending the life of new weapon skin tech such as the one in Ruination. While our outsource team was working with our external vendor on the K/TAC skin line, I felt that the materials we were using could be improved to deliver a super clean Battlepass skin for players.

The 2D concept for the K/TAC skins included an interesting faceted (like a gem!) material in the magazines. To try to mimic that, I developed a custom Normal Map, which is a special type of texture that can bend light that hits the gun in unique directions. The final Normal Map pulled that inspiration from the concept and the final gun model. Finally, I created an additional texture that could flow like water through that custom Normal Map to create a magical and oily effect to serve as an energy source.

When looking at real world brands, and then looking at Kingdom and the lore we’ve established in the VALORANT universe, I knew we needed to add some branding on the weapons to really tie these skins together. For that, I worked with our art director on Premium Content to create the brand for the K/TAC skins to add that extra finish polish.

FUTURE TECH
I hope this gives you all a bit of an insight into the less visible work we do behind the scenes to develop fresh and exciting new skins! As always, we carry other day-to-day responsibilities that take up time, but it’s always a great feeling when we can work on developing new tech like the type explained here to help level up VALORANT gun skins.
Hey VALORANT competitors. My name is Ian “Brighteyz” Fielding, and I’m writing as part of the Competitive team today to guide you through VALORANT’s Competitive mode, show you how it all works, and share some of the ‘why’ behind our team’s decisions. Competitive mode will be available soon after patch 0.49, starting with EU and NA.

VALORANT’s Competitive mode uses the same in-game rules and format as the Unrated mode, but with a focus on higher-stakes competition. VALORANT's competitive system is still in its early stages, and we plan to evolve it over time, but we have a core experience we wanted to share with you all in closed beta so that we can build and evolve the mode together. While we plan to keep Unrated mode always available, Competitive matchmaking may be disabled for short periods throughout the closed beta as we work to refine the mode and incorporate your feedback.

Our system aims to solve some of the common pain points we've seen players experience with competitive modes and ranked systems. We're taking your personal skill into account so we can recognize when you're crushing it, combat smurfing, reduce players with ‘boosted’ ranks, and ensure that for most of your matches, you and your teammates are placed into a fair fight.

Alright! Here’s a bite-size summary, with more details below.

Complete 20 Unrated matches to unlock Competitive mode
8 ranks, 3 tiers each, except the top rank, VALORANT
Queue with up to 5-player parties, must be within 2 ranks
Rank isn’t displayed if competitive matches aren’t played within 14 days, but your rank doesn’t decay behind the scenes.
Closed beta rank does not carry over to launch
ENTER THE RANKS
VALORANT_RANK_ASSET.jpg
The option to enter Competitive matchmaking will open once you’ve completed 20 Unrated matches. Consider this a necessary warmup before the sweat starts.

There are eight levels of rank, each divided into three tiers: Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Immortal, and our highest rank — VALORANT. Winning games is the most important factor in gaining rank, but if you perform exceptionally well, your rank can go up faster. Inversely, losing games and performing well below expectations (deduced from your previous matches) will reduce your rank.

Your personal performance will have a greater impact on the early evaluation of your skill, but will decrease in importance when compared to wins, as we hone in on your skill over time. Competitive mode also measures how decisively you win or lose. We figure, if there is a benefit to your rank that comes from playing your best for the entire match, it will incentivize you to stay in the fight and not throw games.

For those at the VALORANT rank level, winning and how decisive games are won or lost will be the only factor we measure, because at the highest levels of competitive play, we trust you and your teammates have earned your way there.

COMPETITIVE INTEGRITY
Our rank and competitive matchmaking system is meant to deliver a balanced fight and keep the disruption to a minimum.

Factoring in your total performance also helps us better detect smurfs, prevent rank boosting, and get to an accurate display of your skill (rank) much quicker. This way you’ll have more trust that you're playing in balanced matches with players that have actually earned their ranks.

Planting the Spike can be more fun with friends, so you can queue into competitive matchmaking with a party of up to 5 people. We want players to feel supported when playing in a team of up to 5, because we see it as a key part of competitive play in VALORANT. But whoever you party with must be within 2 ranks (6 tiers) from you. This requirement is to help ensure that there isn’t a huge skill disparity in games where one player is clearly above or below the average skill of other players in the match.

We’ve also taken steps to ensure that you’re on a level playing field regardless of your queue size. Our competitive matchmaking takes into account your pre-made party size, and automatically optimizes your match to favor similar premade sizes on the opposing team.

Rank inactivity will also be tracked. If you haven't played a competitive match in 14 days, then your account will be considered “inactive” and your rank will be hidden. Don’t worry, your rank will be displayed again after your first match back. We want to be confident that when others see your rank, it's an accurate reflection of your skill. After 14 inactive days, we don’t have as high of confidence in displaying your rank. However, we won’t decay your rank artificially in the background, so don’t sweat it if you're one of those players that is always on top of their game.

COMPETITIVE PROGRESSION, AND BEYOND
The VALORANT community will lead the way on how our team evolves competitive mode and the rank systems during closed beta and especially after launch. We’re currently tinkering with how to add an element of persistent rank progression that recognizes your competitive accomplishments for all ranks outside of just the match rank display.

Expect to hear more on this and other improvements on VALORANT’s competitive mode and rank as we get closer to launch.
Hello we are Chris Stone. Senior Weapons Artist, and Sean Bigham, Senior Concept Artist, here to tell and show you how the Glitchpop skins were born out of a misunderstanding and grew into one of VALORANT’s most loud, colorful and bold designs.

Glitchpop is heavy on the visual elements that bring out the futuristic fantasy for players. The muzzle flash, glitch equip, holographic projector, and stickers were all elements that we could clearly theme in the cyberpunk genre, while offering a great first-person visual experience.

A MEGA-MISUNDERSTANDING
Article_GPoP_1.jpg
While working on a completely unrelated skin line, we gave some feedback to our concept artist that was (thankfully) misunderstood and led to a very unique design we dubbed “Megapunk.” The rest of the team saw the design and raved. We knew we had something special, but it needed the right kind of push. 

THE THEMATIC GOAL
Glitchpop was an opportunity to offer our fresh take on a favorite science fiction subgenre, cyberpunk.

With so many amazing representations of all things cyberpunk, we didn’t want to lean too heavily towards any one of them. We had an opportunity to take inspiration from the cyberpunk genre but offer our own fresh take on it. We pulled inspiration from Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, Love Death and Robots, Josan Gonzalez, Altered Carbon, Deus Ex, Ruiner, and many others. Ultimately, we wanted to focus instead on how to push this skin line towards a more fun and punk aesthetic vs. the classic gloomy and grounded dystopian representation we often see. To keep ourselves oriented towards this thematic goal, we coined the term “Playful but Deadly.” 

The term branched into the product pillars for this line: Bold. Colorful. Playful. Graphic. These were established before we cemented the VALORANT Brand Tones. Turns out, they line up very well (even if accidentally!).

Article_GPoP_9.jpg
Still, we of course did reference some classic cyberpunk themes:

The world is a futuristic Corporatocracy. Everything appears happy through corporate imagery and advertisements but has an underlying dystopian twist.
Corporations are specifically targeting younger audiences with fun characters, brighter colors, and are trying to be less overtly megacorp.
The stickers on these guns are all corporate branding that appears counter-culture to consumers.
Overall, we loved the juxtaposition of a lethal weapon paired with happy colors and playful stickers.
We’re creating a lifestyle and casualness around something that’s anything but.
Weaving the narrative ties in every facet of Glitchpop were important to give it the feel as if pulled from an alt-universe. We relied on the genuine but less familiar cyberpunk themes to be the forefront of our design, with hopes to avoid cliches.

CONCEPT EVOLUTION
There’s no delusion that we all have a very North American perspective of how we view Cyberpunk. That’s why one of our other concept artists, who’s from Russia, brought a lot of elements that Western players are not typically used to seeing. His initial idea with the Bulldog set the foundation of how we would approach the design—create the stock version and add the punk attitude.

01
02
Our concept artist Sean Bigham worked with our external partner to help guide the concepts that were used to make the models you see in game today. 

Early development of the gun focused on designing a factory fresh, stock version of the weapon which had a modular aspect to it built upon many recognizable hallmarks found in sci fi and cyberpunk: grey plastics, emissive lights and copper elements. Once the base design was resolved, we began experimenting with various ways to push the personalization of the weapons in order to have a fresher take on the genre.

Initially, we had our concept partner go very far with a bunch of different ideas. Each one felt very different from the next but hit certain cyberpunk thematics we had established. Ultimately, we wanted the partner to focus on creating guns that appeared like they could be purchased off the shelf and then upgraded with aftermarket parts to suit their needs and style.

This is where the “upgrade” with a holographic logo projector, a digital glitch muzzle flash, and a glitch equip effect came in. We didn’t want to simply slap on these elements though, we wanted to find a way to integrate them into the gun with some sort of functionality in order to solidify the design. Looking at the Bulldog, the copper cable runs from the battery on the right side to the holographic projector seen in first person, which then runs down the gun towards the barrel for the digital muzzle flash.

01
02
From a design standpoint, we thought it would be good to allow for the stickers, glitch effect, and projector to stand on their own. From a color standpoint, simplifying the gun to a color gradient that has a contrast with carbon fiber and copper trim helped the stickers pop a lot on the gun.

Our partner was able to contribute a wide variety of ideas without explicit guidance every step of the way. They were excited about working on the skin line and brought ideas to the table through their explorations, which ended up benefiting and improving the initial idea.

LOGO EVOLUTION (AKA BRING ON SEAN BIGHAM)
01
02
Memorable logos are always a challenge. Now try creating ones that someone wants to decorate their weapon with.

We knew that we wanted to deepen the fantasy by thinking about how the weapon would be personalized with stickers and holographic elements that reference “real” brands in a cyberpunk alternate universe.These needed to target a mixture of happy and serious tones that are both corporate feeling and somehow punk.

The logos should interact nicely with the company name from a design standpoint and should not feel like a company just slapped their logo onto a cool image. Also, we didn’t want any logos that were too on-the-nose cyberpunk. Remember, less cliche the better.

Finally, we wanted to have a fun mix of food, beverage, security, and other random brands. Unico Pomade ended up being one of the favorites (a hair care brand). Other favorites are NSSDLE, Mons Pain, and Monster Burger. Yummy.

Our first round of logos were way too corporate—a hand-made feel was missing. So then, we moved to the other end of the spectrum. The revisions appeared very hand crafted, but no longer evoked any corporate imagery or feelings. Eventually, we hit the sweet spot. Logos that have a corporate touch but feel very playful and fun.

NOW, THE FUTURE
Article_GPoP_6.jpg
With Glitchpop, we think we made a VALORANT skinline that glimpses into a dystopian future, where death has no consequence but it’s life breathes through bright, colorful skins, and a playful but deadly attitude. 

We hope you enjoy them!
Hi, VALORANT community! Preeti Khanolkar (Producer) and Sean Marino (Art Lead) are back! Last time, we talked to you about the design for the base arsenal and how our team develops skin fantasies within the bounds of competitive integrity. Today, we’re ready to delve into the details of how the Premium Content team built our most ambitious skin yet: Elderflame.

Editor’s Note: Before we named it Elderflame, the entire team called the skin line by the code name “Dragon” for over a year. You’ll see us call it Dragon throughout this article because it’s the best way to tell the Elderflame story.

Dragon is a skin line that’s been close to our hearts as far back as 2015. It’s a testament to our love of VALORANT, our dreams of what a skin in VALORANT could be even before the base weapons existed, and our aspirational barometer. For us, Dragon was precisely about its unexpectedness—no picture or concept could fully convey our vision: a living, breathing creature.


“WE’RE NOT READY TO MAKE DRAGON”

In 2018, our senior concept artist, Timur Mutsaev, designed the very first Dragon concept, then known as “Elemental Dragon.” Although it showed incredible potential and hyped the team, there was no world where we could start working on it. That is, we didn’t have a grasp of the VALORANT skins art style, or even know what the game’s skins could be. We hadn’t even finished making all of the base weapons!

When anyone asked when we’d make that badass Dragon skin, the answer was a consistent “We are not ready to make Dragon,” usually heard from Marino.

“ARE WE DOING THIS?”

By 2019, we had made our first few evolving skins and making Dragon a reality began to sound more plausible.

But before solving art and design questions (there were many), first we had to decide if we should even make it. There were some doubts on the team about whether players would even want dragon skins at all, especially given VALORANT’s more grounded tone.

In the meantime, we kicked off brainstorming for new skin ideas but Dragon still remained in the back of our minds. To no one’s surprise, Preeti snuck it onto the team’s brainstorm whiteboard and several team members voted for it.

Worldwide skin concept testing also gave us confidence that, yes, players did indeed like dragons and they wanted a dragon skin in VALORANT.

ANATOMY LESSON

Dragon-Operator-First-Concept-old-style.jpg
Next, we had to think about the shape and anatomy of a dragon (yeah, gross) and how that would map to our weapons so they’d still be recognizable. The Vandal, Operator, and Judge were clear contenders but the pistol initially stumped us, as we realized a pistol Dragon skin would result in… anatomically challenging reload animations. We eventually made it work on the Frenzy, preserving both anatomy and decorum as you’ll see below.

Also, could we have weapon animations that made the dragon feel alive? Would it have a negative gameplay impact? And, after all those considerations and restrictions, how far could we actually push the fantasy?

With a completed concept (thanks Timur!) and strong execution idea, Preeti again asked Marino if he thought the team was ready to start creating Dragon.

He demurred, “We are not ready to make Dragon.” Here’s why:

We needed to develop tech, which we currently lacked
The team needed to get a few cycles of experience making other evolving skins first
We needed to test how long it takes us to make a skin from start to finish—we didn’t want the time cost of making the skin to sacrifice our ability to make other skins
Our artists didn’t know if they were comfortable with hitting the bar yet—we had a team that specialized in making guns, not living creatures!
In late summer 2019, Marino finally said “We are ready to make Dragon.” No one believed that he had changed his mind, but we went to work anyway.

CREATURE FEATURE

“Dragon” is kind of a loaded term that you can’t just toss around. Dragons should wield some element like fire, ice or electricity. It should draw from folklore or risk becoming just another gift shop trinket. A solid vision for Dragon meant artists would know how to execute each of their pieces and quicken overall development.

This led to a fun but heated argument at Lead Designer Trevor Romleski’s desk among roughly eight developers, where we all learned a little more about the difference between dragons, wyrms, wyverns, drakes, and other mythical beasts that some of us had wrongfully assumed were all the same thing.

Trevor told us we weren’t really making a dragon; we were making a drake. (Yeah okay, thanks Trevor). We didn’t pivot away from our idea, but it was an educational exercise nonetheless.

Through a series of questions and imagination, we established four core pillars: Dark & Brooding, Living & Breathing, Loyal, and Lethal.

Dragon’s tone would be powerful and badass. Not cute. We’ll say it again: NOT CUTE. This may sound like a trivial detail, but holding true to the “badass” vs. “cute” tone helped shape several key decisions in Dragon’s development. Our dragon is more in the realm of Game of Thrones than within the whimsy of How to Train Your Dragon.

IT’S HAPPENING!

Audio & Inspiration

Updated_Camel_004.jpg	IMG_0024.jpg
August 19, 2019—we officially kicked off production on the Dragon Vandal. Oddly, it didn’t start with the usual 3D blockout model, but with sound.

Sound Designer Isaac Kikawa is a pretty low-key guy, and one day just casually shared several minutes of audio with the team. Eyes closed, with nothing to expect, the first few seconds made it clear that Isaac had given Dragon a voice: distinct, powerful and threatening. It inspired us.

Isaac explained that he mixed all sorts of sounds to create the dragon’s roars: walruses, Bengal tigers, and of course the Yellow Backed Chattering Lory, among others. He also managed to strip audio from a video of an alligator that Marino’s mother happened to record on her cell phone.

About two months before we shipped Dragon, Isaac made a few additional recordings for the Finisher, which meant befriending a very large camel.

Concept & Model

The first task of newly-hired senior concept artist Denis Lakhanov was a daunting one: the Dragon weapon concepts for the Frenzy, Operator, and Judge. His Frenzy design was when we realized that each of the dragons would have their own unique personalities, which would come to life through all of their components working together.

Dragon-Frenzy-Personality-Exploration.jpg
The Judge was the brute of the bunch, and all of the concepts felt like they could fit his temperament.

Dragon-Judge-Personality-Exploration.jpg
We had to make a scope somehow, which led Denis to explore the idea of a dragon with wings that would clasp its wings together to form the scope. Even with a solid tonal direction, the team almost latched onto the idea of a slightly derpy, loveable dragon (Item 1 below). We thought it was funny and endearing, but ultimately not fitting, so we opted for a mixture of 2 and 3.

Dragon-Operator-Personality-Exploration.jpg
Marino started with the 3D model for the Vandal and worked closely on the design for its face to ensure it felt badass. “Not cute,” remember? The magazine was another modeling challenge to solve. Did you know it’s easy to make a magazine made of magma rock accidentally look like poo? We didn’t either.

To 3D model the rest of the dragons, Outsource Managers Hayley Chen-O’Neill and Joel Kittle enlisted support from our external partner who specializes in extremely high-quality 3D art for games. The Frenzy and Judge proved to be very challenging, but the Operator was such an unruly beast that it almost didn’t make it through development. On several occasions, we thought we had to admit to ourselves that a massive, winged Operator just would not work. But, in the end, the team made it work because they couldn’t imagine letting players down.

Animation

Senior Animator Sean McSheehan knew that animation was the most critical component when it came to gameplay, based in part on our earliest playtests with players.

The biggest point of feedback was that it was hard to tell if a gun was ready to fire when their hands didn’t directly interact with it (we had experimented with a “summon” animation for one of our prototypes). Through these player labs and design team playtests, McSheehan learned that a character’s hand motions must match the beats of the base gun’s reload. Otherwise, there’s a risk that the reload feels slower despite literally being the same speed.

McSheehan worked in lockstep with design to validate every motion and ensure that even when he pushed the assets far, it was never too far.

Animation is also where Dragon’s personalities really emerged. The first test was on the Vandal that changed from a panic clawing for the magazine to an enraged beast.

Dragon_Vandal_reload_exploration.gif
Though the idea above didn’t work for the Vandal, it was perfect inspiration for the Frenzy’s reload. As the baby of the brood, a panicky “gimme gimme” reload felt just right. McSheehan also utilized the Frenzy’s tail so it felt as if it were scurrying into the player’s hands.

Dragon_Frenzy_Equip.gif	Dragon_Frenzy_Equip_Alternate.gif
For the Judge, we likened Denis’ concept design to a rhino. It’s big, brooding, and forces its way through all obstacles. He’s impatient and angry too, so he uses his mouth during the reload and crushes the magazine. This earlier animation test felt too playful, while the one that ultimately shipped better captured the Judge’s boorishness.

Dragon_Judge_reload_exploration.gif
Given the size of the Dragon Operator, we felt the weapon carried with it an elderly wisdom. Accordingly, his movements are smooth, flowy, and dramatic. He gives a little snort when you reload him. And though he’s not aggressive like the Vandal or Judge, he’s still dangerous.

Keep an eye out for McSheehan’s subtle idle breathing animations that really give the dragons life.

VFX

Our senior VFX artist, Stefan Jevremovic, had a lot of effects to create for each of the Dragons, all within the realm of fire: smoke, embers, and flames. To give the dragons an extra menacing and lethal feel, he added idle fiery effects, which he embedded within the dragons’ bodies. As the dragons breathed, additional fire effects would ebb and flow deep within the crevices of their scales.

VFX ended up being quite critical for defining not only the Dragon melee, but VALORANT melees in general. First, back to the concept. We had Denis explore a few options for what the melee could be, ranging from a dragon claw all the way to a literal baby dragon. One baby was enough.

Also, it looked like the poor little guy was being choked and we felt weird about that.

Dragon-Melee-explorations.jpg
Once we’d decided that the melee wasn’t a baby dragon, we felt like it was okay to set it on fire. This was also the moment when we realized just how far we could push melees in our game compared to guns! Stefan pushed the fire effects and smoke as far as he felt he could get away with and the result was, surprisingly, very well received...well received enough that Sal Garozzo came running to us to tell us how much he loved the melee. (Sal usually doesn’t have much to say about skins, unless it negatively impacts gameplay, so when he asked “Who made that melee?” we thought we’d done something wrong.)

So, Stefan pushed the melee even further, and then went back to amp up a few other melee skins he’d added effects for in the past.

PENCILS DOWN, EXHALE

As we write this article, we’re putting the very final touches on Elderflame (we’ll stop calling it “Dragon” now): the chroma materials, the chroma VFX, and the Finisher. And the Elderflame card, which fully evokes the idea that Elderflame is a goliath, not just a tiny beast you hold in your hands.

Ares_Dragon_Wingspan_Final_V1_19June2020small.jpg
So, why the name “Elderflame”? We wanted it to feel like a dragon breed that thrives and rules the alternate fantastical world it inhabits. Even with this clear direction, naming this skin line was difficult to say the least.

Truth is, it’s indescribably hard to name something you love and have poured so much passion into—10 months of passion, to be exact—while simultaneously trying to ship a bunch of other skins and cosmetics.

Oh, and the game. We shipped the game. And it has dragons in it!

Hello again! I’m Brian Chang, a member of the Competitive team on VALORANT. This article is going to be a bit different than previous ones in the Game Health series, focused on a very specific topic: map randomness. 

If you’ve ever wondered how it was possible for you to play Icebox for 4 games in a row, you’ve come to the right place! 

A common sentiment that we’ve seen in the past is frustration when you encounter the same map multiple games in a row. In a recent survey, over a third of VALORANT players responded that it is “Extremely Frustrating” to encounter the same map multiple times in a row.

This isn’t too surprising. Playing the same map gets stale quickly, and limits the type of challenges that you face in the game. As a result, we wanted to make sure that we could improve the diversity of maps played without compromising the health of matchmaking (by influencing things like queue times or match balance). 

To explain what changes we made and the results of those changes, let’s first take a look at what the old system looked like.

LAUNCH (JUN. 2020) TO PATCH 1.08 (SEPT. 2020)
When the game initially launched, map selection was truly as random as it could be. When 10 players entered a match, our matchmaker would randomly choose any of the available maps (back then, we had a total of 4 maps). All maps had an identical chance (25%) chance of being chosen, regardless of whether a player had played that map recently. 

Obviously, with only 4 maps available to choose from, players were experiencing consecutive maps quite a bit. Here’s what the distribution of consecutive map streaks looked like during this time period:

05302022_GameHealthSeriesPart2_MapDiversity_Chart_2_v02.jpg
Over the course of 5 games, 26% of players saw the same map 3 or more times.
If you played 5 games during this time period, there was a 26% chance that you’d get the same map 3 or more times in a row. Around 1% of the most unlucky (or lucky?) of you saw the same map 5 times in a row out of 5 games.

PATCH 1.08 (SEPT. 2020) TO PATCH 4.04 (MAR. 2022)
We quickly realized that “full random” selection was not ideal—no matter how much you love a map, 5 consecutive games on Ascent can get stale pretty fast. To combat this, we implemented a “pseudo-random” selection system, aimed at showing maps a player hadn’t seen in recent games. 

This method favored maps that were, on aggregate, not seen by the 10 players in a game. It also heavily punished maps that any player had experienced in a streak recently. 

Long story short, we aimed to reduce the number of streaks encountered, but the selection itself was still a weighted “random” choice. In other words, it was less likely for someone to get unlucky and experience a streak, but it was still very much possible to get unlucky. For instance, a game could have a handful of players who recently played games on Split. This could lead to Split having a mere 5% chance of being selected as a map. However, that 5% chance meant that some players would see the Split 4, or even 5+ times in a row.

Here’s what the new distribution of consecutive streaks looked like:

05302022_GameHealthSeriesPart2_MapDiversity_Chart_3_v02.jpg

As you can see, the number of players experiencing a streak of 3 maps or more went down significantly (26% in the “truly random” method vs. 10% in the “pseudo-random” ticket method). 

As we introduced more maps to the pool, we saw significant reductions in how often players were encountering streaks of the same map. Here’s what the streak distribution looked like as we released more maps (with no major changes to our map selection methodology): 

05302022_GameHealthSeriesPart2_MapDiversity_Chart_4_v02.jpg
Streaks became more rare as we released more maps.
Just by increasing the number of maps possible to play, the number of 3+ streaks went from 10% to 3%, with no changes in map selection methodology!

PATCH 4.04 (MAR. 2022) TO NOW:
The results of the changes up to now led to a significant improvement, enough for us to think that our work here was done for the time being. Your feedback, however, told us there was more to be done. 

In a survey sent out to players in North America around March of this year, 67% of players responded that they feel like they’re encountering the same map multiple times in a row “Often” or “Very Often.” 

05302022_GameHealthSeriesPart2_MapDiversity_Chart_5_v02.jpg
Source: NA Players, March 2022
This was pretty alarming to the team; despite the improvements that we saw in our telemetry, the player perception was that map streaks were still pervasive in the game. On top of surveys, we were also seeing a pretty cyclical weekly “why did I get Icebox 3 times in a row?” Reddit/Twitter post. 

We decided to explore improvements to the system one more time. Specifically, we realized that what you were asking for wasn’t more “random” map selection, but a more diverse one. By trying to make selection random via the old system, we weren’t fully minimizing the “bad luck” scenarios that you were experiencing. 

So instead of making map selection a random process, we instead opted to create a deterministic choice that always selects the map that minimizes streaks. If a certain map showed up too often in your recent history, we would remove that map from the selection pool altogether. From there, we would always choose the map that the 10 players in the lobby had seen the least.

The change was implemented in Patch 4.04, first with a regional test in LATAM, then rolled out to the rest of the world. It was important to us that these changes didn’t increase queue times or worsen match balance, since adversely affecting either of those metrics would be a much more costly tradeoff for us to make.

Here are the results of the most recent changes to map streaks: 

05302022_GameHealthSeriesPart2_MapDiversity_Chart_6_v02.jpg
No player in the first week of April saw the same map 5 times in a row in Competitive queue.
The most significant improvement thus far! The percentage of players experiencing the same map 3 times in a row has now dropped to 0.06% (1 in every 1700 or so players). What’s more is that in this week period that we looked at in Competitive queue, exactly 8 of the several million players saw the same map 4 times in a row. Fun fact, 2 out of those 8 are serial queue dodgers that avoided specific maps (for the other 6, sorry about the insanely bad luck). No player saw the same map 5 or more times in a row. This was done with zero negative impact to queue times or match balance. 

There are other metrics that we tracked alongside map streaks, like how often you saw the same map frequently (not necessarily in streaks), and how long it took before you played each map at least once. Both of these metrics also improved significantly after the changes we made in Patch 4.04.

AND NOW… LATER?
As we mentioned in the most recent Ask VALORANT, we do believe that there are times when agency around map selection does make sense, specifically when it comes to coordinated, high-stakes, competitive team-play, like our planned tournament mode.

At this point, we feel relatively confident that deterministic map picks alleviate much of the pain regarding diversity in map selection. Our most recent surveys also show that sentiment improved after the changes. We’ll continue to monitor our data to see if any additional changes need to be made, but so far, the changes seem good!
INTRODUCTION - THE WAY INTO THE PROBLEM
Comms toxicity covers what we consider unwanted behavior over in-game voice and chat communication. While we can never remove the bad conduct itself from individuals, we can work to deter behavior such as insults, threats, harassment, or offensive language through our game systems. There’s also room to encourage “pro-social” behavior.

As we’ve said before, we’re dedicated to being a strong force in paving the way for a brighter future for all when it comes to comms-related toxicity in gaming. There’s been what we believe to be healthy progress in this area, however, we can see there is more to do.

While there is no silver bullet, we want to walk you through some of the steps we’ve taken (and the measured results), as well as the additional steps we’re planning to take to improve the chat and voice experience in VALORANT.

WHAT HAVE WE DONE SO FAR?
First, let’s talk about the work we’ve done up to this point. When it comes to unwanted communication in our game, there are two primary forms of detection that we rely on.

PLAYER FEEDBACK
The first form of detection is player feedback—specifically reports! One of the reasons we highly encourage all of you to report bad behavior (whether that be someone abusing chat, or being AFK, or purposely throwing), is because we actively track and use that data to administer punishments.

To be clear, this doesn’t mean that anyone who gets reported will get punished—we look for repeat offenders and administer escalating penalties that start from warnings and go all the way to permanent bans (when bad enough).

We’ve talked before about creating player behavior “ratings” when we talked about AFKs in VALORANT. Similarly, we’ve created an internal “comms rating” for each player in VALORANT, so that those who commit repeat offenses are very quickly dealt with.

On the other hand, there are some things that people type and say in our game that are what we consider “zero tolerance” offenses. These are things that make it clear that, based on what’s been said, we simply do not want a player who has committed this offense in VALORANT. When we see reports of this type of language being used, we escalate to harsh punishments immediately. (Currently, these punishments happen after the match has ended—more on that later.)

MUTED WORDS LIST
As I am sure some of you have experienced, automatic text detection isn’t perfect (players have found pretty “creative” ways to bypass our systems), so there will be times where “zero tolerance” words will get by our detection. For this reason, we recently implemented a “Muted Words List” that allows you to manually filter out words and phrases that you don’t want to see in the game.

This serves two functions:

First, knowing that our automatic detection systems aren’t perfect, we want to give some agency to you to filter unwanted communication in the game. Second, we plan on incorporating the words that you filtered using the Muted Words List into our automatic detection in future iterations of the system (so in a way, using the Muted Words List will improve our automatic detections in the future!).

WHAT WERE THE RESULTS?
So far, we’ve explained to you some of the things we’ve done to detect, punish, and mitigate toxicity in VALORANT. This is only the tip of the iceberg and we have a long journey ahead of us, but let’s take a look at some of the results of our actions.
CHAT MUTES
GS_Graph_1.jpg

First are chat mutes, the most common form of initial punishment that we administer for alarming text or voice comms. In January alone, we administered over 400,000 text and voice chat restrictions in the form of a mute. These are automatically triggered when a player types something in chat that we detect as abusive, or when enough reports have accumulated over time (from different players in different games) such that we have strong confidence that a player is abusing text and/or voice.

The road doesn’t end here! Please note that we are working on improving this model so we can confidently detect more words that may be currently dodging the system. We’ll continue to push for improvements on this front.

GAME RESTRICTIONS
GS_Graph_2.jpg

Next up are game restrictions. These are bans that we place on accounts that commit numerous, repeated instances of toxic communication. The bans could range from a few days (for smaller violations by relatively new offenders), to year-long ( for chronic offenders). Permanent bans are reserved for if the behavior is especially egregious and/or repeated.

These bans didn’t ramp up on VALORANT until around the middle of last year (we were trying to make sure bans were fully justified). In January, we dished out over 40,000 bans.

One last point of data we’d like to share: the above numbers are indicators of behaviors that we caught and punished, but not necessarily an indication that toxicity in VALORANT has gone down as a result. In fact, when we surveyed players, we noticed that the frequency with which players encounter harassment in our game hasn’t meaningfully gone down. Long story short, we know that the work we’ve done up to now is, at best, foundational, and there’s a ton more to build on top of it in 2022 and beyond.

We’re trying different ways to engage with the player base in the coming year to better understand where we can improve, and we’ll be sure to be transparent about where we are in terms of the tech we are building and where our head’s at/heading so we can keep the feedback loop open with you all.

WHAT WORK IS PLANNED?
To be sure, we know there is more to do. So we now want to share a bit more about what we’re currently working on:

Generally harsher punishments for existing systems: For some of the existing systems today to detect and moderate toxicity, we’ve spent some time at a more “conservative” level while we gathered data (to make sure we weren’t detecting incorrectly). We feel a lot more confident in these detections, so we’ll begin to gradually increase the severity and escalation of these penalties. It should result in quicker treatment of bad actors.
More immediate, real-time text moderation: While we currently have automatic detection of “zero tolerance” words when typed in chat, the resulting punishments don’t occur until after a game has finished. We’re looking into ways to administer punishments immediately after they happen.
Improvements to existing voice moderation: Currently, we rely on repeated player reports on an offender to determine whether voice chat abuse has occurred. Voice chat abuse is significantly harder to detect compared to text (and often involves a more manual process), but we’ve been taking incremental steps to make improvements. Instead of keeping everything under wraps until we feel like voice moderation is “perfect” (which it will never be), we’ll post regular updates on the changes and improvements we make to the system. Keep an eye out for the next update on this around the middle of this year.
Regional Test Pilot Program: Our Turkish team recently rolled out a local pilot program to try and better combat toxicity in their region. The long and short of it is to create a reporting line with Player Support agents—who will oversee incoming reports strictly dedicated to player behavior—and take action based on established guidelines. Consider this very beta, but if it shows enough promise, a version of it could potentially spread to other regions.
Lastly, we talked about this when we discussed AFKs, but we’re committing to communicating both the changes we make, as well as the results of those changes, in a more regular cadence. It helps us stay accountable, and hopefully helps you stay informed!

EXTRA WORD ON VOICE
When a player experiences toxicity, especially in voice comms, we know how incredibly frustrating it is and how helpless it makes us feel both during the game, as well as post game. Not only does it undermine all the good in VALORANT, it can have lasting damage to our players and community overall. Deterring and punishing toxic behavior in voice is a combined effort that includes Riot as a whole, and we are very much invested on making this a more enjoyable experience for everyone.

VOICE EVALUATION
Last year Riot updated its Privacy Notice and Terms of Service to allow us to record and evaluate voice comms when a report for disruptive behavior is submitted, starting with VALORANT. As a complement to our ongoing game systems, we also need clear evidence to verify violations of behavioral policies before we can take action, as well as help us share with players on why a particular behavior may have resulted in a penalty.

As of now, we are targeting a beta launch of the voice evaluation system in North America/English-only later this year to start, then we will move into a more global solution once we feel like we’ve got the tech in a good place to broaden those horizons. Please note that this will be an initial attempt at piloting a new idea leveraging brand new tech that is being developed, so the feature may take some time to bake and become an effective tool to use in our arsenal. We’ll update you with concrete plans about how it’ll work well before we start collecting voice data in any form.

HOW YOU CAN HELP!
The only thing we’d ask is that you stay engaged with the systems we have in place. Please continue to report toxic behavior in the game; please utilize the Muted Words List if you encounter things you don’t want to see; and please continue to leave us feedback about your experiences in-game and what you’d like to see. By doing that, you’re helping us make VALORANT a safer place to play, and for that, we’re grateful.

We’ll see you in the next update! In the meantime, feel free to send any feedback or questions to members of the S&PD Team:
INTRODUCTION - THE WAY INTO THE AFK PROBLEM

Someone who is “AFK” is someone who leaves or otherwise does not participate during an ongoing game. Most multiplayer games have an issue with AFKs, and all competitive team-based multiplayer games face this issue to some degree or another.

VALORANT is no exception but that doesn’t mean we can’t discourage disruptive behavior. An AFK in a game compromises the competitive integrity of the match (matches aren’t fair if it’s a 4v5), and as a result downgrades general enjoyment of the game. It’s something we knew was a must-solve for players early in the development of the Social and Player Dynamics team.

Earlier this year we updated you on the work to inhibit AFKs (along with some other stuff), where we talked about some improvements that we’d already made and other work that was in progress for AFKs.

When addressing AFKs, we wanted to make sure of a few things:

We don’t punish you for unlucky games. Stuff happens (your cat “accidentally” kicks the power cord out) and we don’t want to punish you for rare, unfortunate circumstances that are out of your control.
We want a scalable way to detect AFKs that avoids false positives. It would be really bad if someone was holding an angle for a while staying completely still and we flagged them as AFK.
We want to make sure that there are clear signals that we can measure to see if our efforts are successful. Without these benchmarks, it would be hard for us to know whether our work actually made a difference, or if you’re still encountering the same amount of AFKs.
WHAT HAVE WE DONE SO FAR?

March this year was our first foray into a system to find AFKs. The simplest version of this system (which is what we started with) was to look for people who had either disconnected from the game, or stayed completely inactive for a prolonged period of time.

This covers most AFKs (from internet going down, to rage-quitting, to cats), but it left us room to improve. Specifically, we didn’t yet cover the potentially more malicious AFKs: people who intentionally do not participate in the game, but stay “active” in the game so as to not get disconnected. These are often the worst to deal with—they intentionally look to ruin the experience of everyone, especially teammates.

To address these situations, we set trackers to look for specific behaviors and metrics in-game that we can then tie to AFKs. We can’t get into specific detail about those trackers (since revealing how we detect AFKs would make it easier for bad actors to bypass those rules). What we can say, however, is that our focus was to make the detection process heavily scalable. When a new behavior or method of detection is identified, it is very easy to look for it in our system (and take action when we find certain behaviors).

Finally, we wanted to make sure punishments for AFK were fair (forgiving for people who AFK on a rare occasion, but severe for serial leavers). To accomplish this, we created an AFK “rating” per player that tracks their AFK behavior across all of their games played. The more a player commits AFKs, the lower their rating becomes, and the harsher their punishment will be on a future violation.

In other words, if you’re a player who rarely or never goes AFK, then your AFK rating will be good, which means that if you do happen to accidentally AFK in a game, you won’t be punished severely (for example, you’d receive a warning message).

Conversely, if a player rage quits every other game, they’ll quickly find themselves going from receiving a warning, to XP denials, to queue restrictions, and eventually banned from playing the game as their rating tanks. Throughout the process of escalating penalties, they’ll have multiple explanations of why we took action, and what behavior they need to change...in case they come crying.

We also wanted to make sure we avoided edge cases, like leaving in the middle of a Deathmatch game. If a player AFKs in Deathmatch, the harshest punishment they will receive is denial of XP for the game that they were AFK in. This is because being AFK in a Deathmatch doesn’t ruin the experience of teammates (everyone is your enemy in Deathmatch). However, we did notice a sizable number of accounts who were farming XP in Deathmatch by entering a game and going AFK.

THE RESULT?

None of this talk matters unless it actually improves your experience playing VALORANT. So how do we find out what worked?

There’s a couple of data points that we look to measure this. We could spend a whole article talking about just the data (in terms of how we measure, potential biases, etc.), but here are some of our benchmarks:

AFKs Detected Over Time
AskVal_December_2021_Graph_1.jpg

To start, here’s our detected severe AFK rate (number of AFKs per game) over time in Unrated and Competitive games. For this graph, we define “severe” AFKs as anyone who is detected as AFK for 6 or more rounds in a match.

The AFK rate stays at a similar level for the first six or so months of launch, but we see detected AFKs take a dive in early 2021. This lines up with when we started implementing our improved AFK detection and penalties.

Overall, the AFK rate in games has more than halved over the last year! Things have once again stabilized at a new, lower value.

AFK Reports
One problem with measuring detected violations is that we don’t really know about AFKs that our system isn’t detecting. Overall, we’re confident that AFKs have gone down, but it’s unclear how much more work there is to be done. One way that we can measure whether you truly feel like you’re experiencing fewer AFKs is to look at report counts.

AskVal_December_2021_Graph_2.jpg

The top graph shows AFK “Report Rate,” the number of reports we receive for AFKs, normalized for hours played. The bottom graph shows the percent change in the AFK report rate over time since the start of the year. As you can see, after a drop in March, report rates are down around 17% since January.

There are some caveats: It could be the case that players “gave up” on reporting, but comparing report rates of other, non-AFK categories over time gives us confidence that this is a material change resulting from our work.

BETTER DETECTION, BETTER INFORMED

The good news from our work so far is that the various detections and interventions that we set in place to detect and penalize/deter AFKs seems to have made a meaningful impact on the frequency with which AFKs happen in your games.

But there’s more to be done!

For one, we can continue to improve detection. Since we first started work on AFKs, we broadened the different behaviors that qualify as an AFK in our system. As players get more… “creative” with how they AFK in game, so will our detection. The added bonus here is that a lot of the more clever AFK techniques tend to overlap with other unwanted behaviors in our game, such as intentionally feeding, griefing, or automated bot account farming (more on this in another article).

Second, we can keep you informed. Sharing both the process and results of our work to improve VALORANT’s community is an outlook to which we are committed. It’s something that you’ve told us you want. It’s one of the reasons we wanted to write these articles in the first place.

As we move ahead, we’ll continue to keep you posted on the state of the game, whether it be on the state of further reducing AFKs, or detecting and acting on some other behavior. What we ask in return is that you continue to provide questions, thoughts, feedback on what you want to see from us to make VALORANT a more safe, fun place to be.

You can find us on Twitter here and here (but we’re all over!).

Thanks for taking the time to read through this. Next time you hear from us, we’ll chat about toxic gameplay behaviors (friendly fire, sabotage, intentionally feeding, etc.).
Hi!

We’re devs who together work on Gameplay Systems in VALORANT—specifically the Social and Player Dynamics team (friends system, text and voice chat, and monitoring player behavior), as well as the Competitive team (competitive systems, MMR,and matchmaking)—here to lay out plans for a series of articles meant to go in-depth on some popular topics.

Something that you’ve voiced to us is that you want more transparency around the Competitive and Social & Player Dynamics (SPD for short) space. Sure, patch notes provide some updates of the things we changed in VALORANT, but we think it’s important to show the impact of our work so far and what’s ahead for this space.

Starting this week, we’ll begin to share a series of deep-dive articles, each of which will cover a very specific topic within our teams. Some articles will share more about the work that’s already happened (and the impact we’ve measured as a result) and some will focus more on planned or ongoing work in a certain area.

Below is the list of areas that we plan to cover. All articles are meant to be a way for you to learn more about topics that you’ve told us that you want to hear more about:

AFKs - Those players who stop playing in the middle of a game
Gameplay toxicity - Such as Intentionally feeding, friendly fire, etc.
Text/Voice chat toxicity - The people who ruin it for everybody
Smurfs, or secondary accounts - We know, probably our most requested topic
Matchmaking/match fairness - in Competitive queue
As we mentioned, we’re planning on releasing these articles periodically. The first topic we’ll dive into is AFKs in VALORANT, and it’s coming out tomorrow.

You can track the series as it updates by clicking the tag found at the bottom of this article.

One last thing! We’ve never done something like this before, so if you have feedback, comments, thoughts, please let us know. It’s possible we don’t hit every topic that you’ve raised concerns over, so if there’s something you don’t think we’ve covered that you’d like to see get some love, please tell us.

The best way is to keep posting your concerns/feedback on your favorite places (Discord, Reddit, etc.) and we’ll see them. Or find the authors of the respective articles above (when they post, we’ll include a link!). You can also always tag the comms team and they can share it right away.
Hi, I’m Joe Lansford, one of the level designers on VALORANT. Now that Fracture has entered the fray, the maps team wanted to take a moment to talk about its creation.

As a refresher, our maps design philosophy since day one on VALORANT is to push each map in a specific direction, instead of trying to accommodate ideal situations for each of the wild number of permutations that our weapons and abilities create. We build each map with a different hook that presents unique scenarios for you to problem solve.

We proposed the same challenge with Fracture and today Brian Yam, one of the lead artists on the maps team, will join me to break it down for you.

EARLY FISSURES - THE DESIGN QUESTION

You may have read by now that we started with the question, “what if attackers could pinch defenders from both sides of the map?” This exploration led to the “H-Shape” layout, ziplines, the four orbs, quadrants, and just about everything else that makes Fracture what it is.

With the novel strategic layer, we didn’t want to do anything too far out there for the moment-to-moment gunplay though, so hopefully you’ve found all that feeling fairly familiar.

It took us a while to get there though. We weren’t really sure what the H-shape was going to do and it required a lengthy iteration period to really lock it down. Here’s what the original looked like:

10072021-HighresScreenshot-inline.jpg

In this iteration, defenders only had a single rotation path through their spawn. There’s a very complex approach here through A Halls/Door area with an under-over (drop into A was also on this side), sites are completely different, there’s a path alongside ziplines, a wider map, etc. Lots of differences—I think the tunnel under B is about the only thing that didn’t change!

But the “footprint” was there. The team was sold on the core promise of the map, enough to work through the problems.

This led us to our next big breakthrough: a safer rotation for defenders through their spawn (it seems so simple in hindsight). This was critical for giving defenders more options in how they could set up and move. The previous version often ended in situations where post-plant attackers would have enough utility left to completely choke out defenders in their spawn.

10072021-HighresScreenshot2-inline.jpg

In the above image, you can see the defender structure start to take shape as well as both the sites looking much closer to what we have today. Not to mention some stand-in thematic development even as early as the greybox phase.

At one point, we tried an additional set of ziplines (as seen in the below mini map image) linking Arcade and Dish areas as well as a second bridge cutting across the middle of the map for attackers.

10072021-fracture_FogOfWar-inline.png

Once the defender area got sorted, the next big task to take on were all the neutral spaces. As you can see in the minimap above, these areas were quite different.

With the next few iterations, we wanted to make these areas a little more paced and desirable for defenders to take and hold—giving them an option to either push through and flank, or use as a retake position.

One of those areas, the Dish, was actually an idea that came from some concept references I was looking at after we decided on the desert direction for A side. A radar dish broken down in the desert was such a striking image, I felt I had to try to make the gameplay work (it was originally a good bit more complex and open).

10072021HighresScreenshot3-inline.jpg

After that, it was just lots of fine tuning.

For the visual theme, the team had a bunch of great ideas (one of our favorite parts of the map creation process is pitching visual themes), that I’m going to keep secret in case we use them in the future. But we were pretty excited about the idea of the dual biomes and it presented a great storytelling opportunity.

There are two factions working together in secret. Something goes wrong and the world is ripped apart. The visuals and gameplay both came together to deepen the world of VALORANT. (And our first in-game narrative content!)

WHAT HAPPENED HERE? - THE DESIGN QUESTION

Hello, this is Brian Yam, and I’m one of the art leads on the maps team. Now that you’ve read Joe on the design side (and spent some time playing Fracture), I’ll guide you on the visual development of Fracture in a similar way.

When Fracture’s theme was first conceived during the pitch phase, we wanted to push the idea that this map was visually split from it’s lore aspect, but also from a visual perspective. Since most of you generally identify a map through art visuals, the concept team wanted to capitalize on this.

For art the big question was this: “How can we create a visually compelling map that prompts players to question what happened here? What caused the split on both sides?” This was also an opportunity to help hint at the presence of Kingdom Omega into the narrative.

VISUAL DEVELOPMENT

Below is a very early sketch of the overall map from the greybox. In the initial concepts, our goal was to establish a visual direction of what this place is and why it exists in this space.

A compelling idea to us was to have a science facility sit atop of a canyon, partially hidden. To address the visual lore, we established two extreme contrasts that resulted from an experiment gone wrong. We went with a desert biome for Omega Sector and overgrown foliage with Alpha Sector, with the rift dividing both sides.

Artistically, this created a visual contrast in color palette of warm versus cool, and desertification against forestation. We thought you would also appreciate this contrast for callouts and memorizing each side distinctively.

One of the most important concepts we typically establish early on at the end of “blue sky” development (where anything goes) is to create what we call a dollhouse. The next image is of a dollhouse for Fracture created by our senior concept artist, Theo Aretos. This high level concept helped establish the shape language, color palette, and general direction of the mood we wanted.

From there, the concept team starts to focus on more specific concepts within the greybox locations. The art team works closely with level designers to iterate on specific concepts within those locations.

10072021-dollhouse-inline.jpg

At this point we also want to get a clear concept of how the layout of the map will be from a top down view, which shows the overview of the map along with callouts noted with rough thumbnail concepts of where key locations are.

In the example below, this type of information was helpful for an initial art block out where 3D artists build a more refined 3D blockout over the level design greybox to reflect compositional and silhouette shapes inspired by our concept art .

10072021-Fracture_plan_layout_inline.jpg

Key Concepts

The following images are some of the key concepts that helped drive the artistic direction of the visual target for Fracture. These images are the final version of a concept for two areas (hopefully you recognize them) that provided a general direction for our 3D artists to hit.

10072021-overcast-inline.jpg

10072021-Asite_dish-inline.jpg

Concept to Art Blockout

For some background, the concept team initially completes the first stage concepts prior to initial “art blockout”. Typically, we establish roughly 70-75% completion of concepts in each area that are adequate for art blockout.

Art blockout is where we start building a rough 3D shell which represents the shapes of the architecture, landscape, and environment composition from the concept art which is tied closely to greybox parameters. Here’s are some examples on Fracture—

Greybox design mesh:

10072021-HighresScreenshot46-inline.jpg

Art blockout on attack spawn and dish:

10072021-HighresScreenshot697-inline.jpg

10072021-HighresScreenshot872-inline.jpg

A lot of collaboration between the design and art team happens here. The reason for this is because the level design is still undergoing changes after the art blockout is created, and many adjustments and tuning still needs to be done.

Art Production

This is the fun part! Now that we have all the nuances for gameplay and initial art block out pretty much locked down, this is where we go into production to finish up the final 3D art. The final art typically represents the concepts, but they can change along the way if we discover improvements.

It’s fun to watch players discover the lore and develop interpretations just through the art. In VALORANT tradition, how many tacti-bears can they find throughout this map?

And for the next map...here’s Joe again with the final word.

CHECK YOUR INBOX

It’s been really fun watching you solve the gameplay opportunities of Fracture. The meta is barely starting to form and everyone on the team is eager to see how it evolves over time.

As for what comes next on “map 8,” no spoilers, but you might find some clues in those Fracture emails. Hopefully they’re not lost in your spam folder.
As a follow up to our discussion several weeks ago about the Creation of Split, we wanted to provide clarity on our overall map creation process with a focus on our latest map, Ascent. As you might imagine, it takes quite a while for a map to evolve from initial idea to landing in your laps. Ascent was one of the very first maps that we put together on VALORANT and was the place where we developed and refined much of the core gameplay that you experience today.

It’s been on a long road...

The whole map process kicks off with a stage called Incubation. This is where the designer builds a proposal that establishes a design goal, clear constraints to work within and a unique visual experience for players. These proposals usually include top-down plans of the map and often contain simple 3D models that can be experienced in our engine.

Since Ascent was the foundational experience for VALORANT, the goal of this map was to create a traditional three-lane tactical experience that also allowed players to alter connections through the use of a mechanical door. It was designed to be a baseline experience for future maps to grow from.

Ascent_InArticle_Image_1.jpg
Once we have an idea that the team is excited about, we move into the Greybox phase of development, which can take anywhere from several months to several years. During this phase we build a rough model of the environment in our engine, set up all the core gameplay elements, roughly prototype new elements (like those mechanical doors), and then play it extensively.

The key here is to fail fast, playing new iterations of the map several times a week. This is where we dial-in every sightline, encounter distance, opening width and all the other nuances that you see in our maps today. We only leave Greybox once everyone feels confident in the intended design direction and when the map is playing really well.

Ascent’s creation coincided with the iteration of VALORANT itself, including further design on the impact of abilities, the power at range of each weapon, and even our IP direction—so Ascent stayed in Greybox for close to three years.

old_asc_1_rev_v2.jpg
This next phase of map development, Block-in, begins with concepts of the high-level vision for the visual experience. This two month process attempts to answer all lingering questions on the map. By the time this phase is complete, we want gameplay to be silky smooth and fully understand what every single structure and cover object looks like. Ideally, once a map leaves this phase all we are doing is executing on art. 

Ascent_InArticle_Image_2.jpg
During the early stages of Block-in we are also looking at the overall composition of the map and how it helps inform player orientation and navigation. Essentially we ask how can the art make the map play better? For example, how can we use architectural hierarchies in the map to reinforce the important parts of the game such as the objective sites and major routes of circulation?

AscentComps.gif
With Ascent, we started with the idea that a chunk of medieval Italy had been ripped out of the ground and thrown into the sky. We then needed to assess how this visual direction would integrate with the Greybox layout that was playing so well.

This is where ideas such as the central tower came into existence and where we started accentuating Site A, the high point of the map, with the domed basilica and Site B, the low point of the map, with the drained canal and boathouse.

Ascent_InArticle_Image_3.jpg
While the artists and designers tag team the Block-in process, Art Production responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of the amazing artists of the Map team. Here we use the concepts finalized in Block-in to build an environment experience that is memorable for players and that also makes the map play better.

One rule that we try to adhere to is the idea of a clean gameplay zone across the map. This specifically means that we keep the majority of artistic detail of the map below about 1 foot in elevation or higher than 9 feet. The area in between, which we call the Clean Zone, then becomes a simplified space with high visibility. We want our agent silhouettes and especially the head to read very clearly as players putting rounds on target is key to winning the game.

Ascent_InArticle_Image_4_v2.jpg
Beyond this area, the artists can really use their talents to craft spaces that feel special. Art Production can last upwards of 6 months and also involves tasks such as adding ambient audio to help make each part of the map feel alive.

On Ascent, and all of our other maps, we spent a good deal of time identifying key points of interest (POIs) through statues and murals that again helped players orient themselves.

You can see this with callouts such as Courtyard, Garden and Market.

AscentProgression_02.gif
Although this process can take up to a year to complete, Ascent took close to five years as it continued to evolve along with the game itself. It has been a long journey but in many ways we are just getting started. In patch 1.02, we reduced some of the angle complexity on the map and we will continue to improve things with the help of all of you.

As always, thanks for the continued feedback and we will see you out there on the floating isle!
Howdy folks! My name is Chris Carney and I am the Lead Level Designer on VALORANT. Today, along with the legendary Level Designer Sal Garrozzo, we will be discussing the question: Where did the Split come from and how did we bring it from a loose, rough idea to a polished launch experience?

Loading_Screen_Split_v2.jpg
The design philosophy behind our maps on VALORANT is relatively simple. We have a wide range of characters with an array of abilities who can also wield a multitude of weapons. Instead of trying to create maps that all provide an equal number of ideal combat situations for the crazy number of permutations, we instead push each map in a specific direction.

For example, on Bind we ask “what if we remove the middle area of the map (i.e. “Mid”), which typically provides flanking opportunities on a traditional two objective map?” How would that affect the way five-player teams play defense or how they attack? Can we even build a map that works well with this constraint? This becomes the design goal of the map.

The intent here is not to have a “gimmick” for each map, but instead to center the map around a specific gameplay experience that we can create with the map geometry. We also evaluate new map mechanics, such as one-way teleporters or ascenders, and see how these can help us achieve this goal.

With a clear target, we are then able to evaluate if this type of experience works well for VALORANT. If the map does not play well when we start playtesting, we can determine if we are just executing on it poorly or if our goal is wrong for the game. However, if it’s working well, we can then focus on how to make it better. Each map becomes a new challenge for players to solve. This creates gameplay diversity within our map roster while allowing certain characters and team compositions to shine.

As you can imagine, it doesn’t always work out. There are greybox levels (a “greybox” is our earliest playable version of a map) that will never see the light of day. On the other hand, some levels have withstood the test of time and have gone through literally years of iteration to earn a spot on our final roster.

Split is one of these experiences.

THE BUILD
For Split, the question focused on whether or not we could create an off-site position that was essential to defending or capturing each site. To put it even more simply, could a tactical map play like King of the Hill?

01
02
The original design had a single tower in the center with bullet proof glass that allowed Defenders to see the approach of the Attackers. During playtesting, we found that the tower did indeed provide an off-site position that was critical to hold, but it was too powerful and pulled too much combat away from the objective sites themselves. So we decided to break the tower into two smaller towers that focused on each site.

The next version pushed more of the action to the objective sites with Mid giving players access to the new smaller towers. Instead of looking at Attacker spawn, these two spots overlooked each objective site and provided strong overwatch as Attackers or Defenders. It started creating unique gameplay opportunities that worked well within the game. Taking a tower helped Attackers take the sites.

We were onto something! However, Mid was still too critical and the overwatch positions were also too disconnected from the sites themselves.

01
02
The third major revision firmly connected the towers to the sites which allowed them to be a core part of the combat around the objectives. Players could jump out of the towers onto the sites and use ladders to travel in the reverse direction. While these elements worked well, Mid unfortunately had become a large, porous mess of connections and was still the main hotzone on the map. We had some work to do.

The best solution was to break Mid into two halves and then connect these directly with hallways, which became the “Vent” and “Sewer” that you experience today. This allowed us to divide Mid combat into focusing on attacking and defending each tower. In addition, we further crafted the objective sites where ignoring control of the tower would make holding the site itself more difficult. Our goal of creating off-site positions that were essential to each site was working.

We finally had something that the team was excited about and it was time to move the map into Art Production.

MAKING IT REAL
While Split was undergoing all of these revisions, VALORANT had moved through several thematic directions and was now focusing on locations inspired by real places on Earth. The foundation of VALORANT’s combat model has always focused on tactical shooting using real world weapons with a few spectacular moments punctuated by the use of abilities. We wanted the world to reflect this as well.

biggestboi_v2.jpg
Split was now a Japanese city under a dramatic transformation as Kingdom transformed the daily lives of everyday citizens while increasing its footprint. This new direction provided city courtyards and alleys that would match up well with the layout of the map, while also adding a few futuristic moments of spectacular goodness. The Map Art team then went about creating an incredible old world city that lives under the shadow of a massive Kingdom R&D facility.

Since we always want our art to help clarify gameplay, and each area around the towers and objectives needed to be clearly memorable, we divided up the map into two distinct sectors. B Site was to be the older district in the city, while A Site was to be part of an ever expanding, new Kingdom tech campus. Each part of the city would also be anchored around a Raidanite Generator which would identify the objective sites.

01
02
Cities can be visually overwhelming and player orientation and navigation are always critical. We want players executing strategies and fighting enemies rather than fighting the layout of the map. By separating the map into two distinct visual themes we were able to generate unique places of interest (POIs) that complemented each side of the city. These POIs are critical to the design of any map and, along with a clean composition of space, help players build an easy mental map of how the places connect.

In the end, Split was released and we continue to refine these ideas with the help of players. Patch 1.0 included further revisions to the Mid section connecting to B tower and we will still be watching and evaluating how everything is working.

Look for more stories about the maps in our launch roster in the future. Meanwhile—see you in the city!
Hey everyone! I'm Lydia Zanotti, a 3D environment artist on VALORANT. With the release of Icebox, I thought it was the right time to bring you in from the cold and discuss how we bring our maps to life, from the inside out.

The VALORANT maps team is fairly small, and consists of level designers, 3D, concept, lighting, and QA. It's a real collaborative feat getting a map from greybox (the earliest playable version of a map) to a version that's ready for you, the player.

Icebox_Splash_v2.jpg
When it comes to maps, level design normally grabs most of the attention, and rightfully so, as designers spend months working on the greybox-playtesting and tweaking them until they are ready to hand off to the artists.

Today you're going to hear from the 3D artist perspective. That's me, the person who works on models, textures, sculpts, paint, shaders, and building the overall visual world. I hope to give you some insight into the challenges, successes, and misconceptions of crafting map environments.

If you want a closer look at how we approach level design, check out this story on the creation of Split.

AFTER LEVEL DESIGN
Icebox_Dollhouse_v2.jpg
Before 3D artists can touch a map, our Art Lead and Creative Director work very high level with the concept artists to iterate on finding an iconic look for our maps using a series of blue-sky concepts. At this stage there's a lot of back and forth between the artist and project leadership to make sure the map follows the VALORANT narrative, is marked by visual variety, and most importantly, is something the team is really excited to be working on.

After a high-level direction has been locked down, concept artists begin to tackle specific locations and call-outs on the map based on the greybox layout. At this stage, the concept artists try to get as much coverage on the map before the 3D artists jump in and begin modeling the basic shapes of the architecture.

Icebox_ConceptB_v2.jpg
MAP FOUNDATIONS
Our map production pipeline can be broken down into several phases: greybox, art blockout, and art production.

Our maps are completely built using Unreal Engine 4, and the majority of the team uses Maya for 3D modeling (though a few of us use 3ds Max).

gif_IceboxProg3.gif
As we start to model the maps, we try to playtest them on a weekly basis to get a feel for the spaces, check for bugs, make sure there is accurate collision, and to spot areas that are too noisy or compete visually with our Agents.

The level designers can make changes to the spaces as we're modeling them, and we have to pivot to those changes when necessary. This often happens during the art blockout and early stages of building the maps. Since concepts and layouts can shift, it's better to work with simple shapes during the blockout phase to avoid having to re-do work.

Two good examples of this can be seen in the Icebox blockout phases of "kitchen" and "mid," where changes were made to give some spaces more breathing room.:

gif_IceboxProg2.gif gif_IceboxProg1.gif
OUT OF BOUNDS
Our main goal on the maps team is to not only provide the player with a beautiful looking map, but to provide one that also runs well. We may start with ambitious concepts, but at some point we have to reasonably limit how creative we can get. This is due to either having to adhere to the greybox layout, or because of performance constraints.

Performance is super important in tactical shooters, and we spend a lot of time working with engineers when we finish a map to clean it up and have it running as smoothly as possible. There are many ways we do this and there are always trade-offs like having to sacrifice visual quality to get a small performance gain. Those small gains add up, and they matter.

Optimizing a map is simple, however, as we can gather data to see what textures are taking up the most memory in the map, or which areas of the map have too many draw calls (or amount of assets in view). To help with this, we can "instance" meshes-meaning that if there is a pile of the same 20 rocks, we can instance them together, so that the engine reads them as one mesh. This helps us immensely as we populate the maps with a ton of props.

CONSTRUCTION, MINUS THE HARD HATS
For some insight into my personal work on Icebox, most of my time was spent on the B-site half of the map. When I began work on the Spike plant area, I was provided several concepts to work from to get an idea and feel for what I'm about to create. While we don't have to stick to the concepts 100%, we do make sure that we stick to the greybox.

We often export the greybox meshes and then 3D model over them so that the walls and edges line up perfectly. This is especially important in areas with heavy gameplay (more on that later).

Icebox_ConceptA_v2.jpg
We try to model and get the basic architectural shapes into the map before starting to unwrap and texture them. When we start to add colors on the meshes, we make sure that they aren't too dark, especially in interior spaces. The objective here is to maintain gameplay integrity by making sure that the environment doesn't impede with clarity, and that the characters are always clearly visible.

gif_IceboxProg4_reduced.gif
As far as texturing goes, we primarily use tiling textures and trim sheets on our buildings and large structures. These are created using a variety of programs such as Zbrush, Substance Designer, Substance Painter, and Photoshop. We do use custom textures on props when needed, such as the coffee machine in the kitchen, or the forklift near A-site.

MORE ON MAP CLARITY
Again, while our artist goals are to carry out the look and feel of a map, it is always subordinate to gameplay clarity and making sure the Agents are always clearly visible when they should be.

To help with visual noise, we make sure that our materials are similar in value and there isn't too much contrast or darkness. We can also improve clarity by using lights to illuminate dark areas, or to spotlight spaces where you would want the most visibility possible, such as a Spike plant site or a commonly peeked corner.

01
02
MAP MOTIFS
The sky's the limit on the maps we make -- for the most part. Adding graffiti, props, and small details to the map is how we tell a story to the players. When it comes to details, we try to keep the majority of it above player height so that the angles and peeks are simple and clear. We also consider designing areas in a way where it can actually help to guide your crosshair placement.

For theming and call-outs on the maps, it’s best to come up with ones that are simple and easily understood to avoid the pain of hearing your teammates scream “over there!” when really they mean “garage” or “market.”

We also consider callouts that are quick and easy to say while in the heat of a match. Some of our callouts are very obvious, such as “kitchen.” In other cases, we try to use colors as a way to help distinguish certain areas and structures, like the yellow shipping container on B-site.

01

Fun with storytelling and worldbuilding is probably the best part about being an environment artist. Each artist working on the map gets to add their own flavor to their sections of the ma—and sometimes even secretly sneak in a Tacti-bear somewhere. We use our best judgement and follow concepts where provided, but if we have cool ideas or something inspires us, we let that creative energy out into the maps.

One way we add more visual interest and story into the maps while sticking to greybox is to build outside of the gameplay space. An example of this would be the Bunker built into the glacier wall on B-site. Inside, I created an interesting storage space with a curving tunnel, without having to worry about gameplay since the player can’t go into this area anyway.

Hello! I’m Aaron Cheney, a software engineer on VALORANT’s Performance team. Performance is a key component to maintaining VALORANT’s competitive integrity, and our team is the one responsible for monitoring, maintaining, and improving both server and client performance.

We’re excited to provide an update on a feature that has been in development for several months: Global Invalidation. We’ll get into the details of the feature shortly, but first let’s spend some time looking at how this feature has impacted client performance since patch 4.03.

Spoiler alert: it’s pretty awesome.

AskVal_March22_Global_Invalidation_Graph_3.jpg

Global Invalidation has provided significant improvements for a large part of our player base. In fact, it’s the single largest performance gain for clients since launch.

Although these charts are exciting—and we’re thrilled with the results—it’s important to understand exactly what you’re looking at. We work with large, complex data sets; organizing, filtering, and controlling the data helps us understand the player experience. Here’s what you need to keep in mind to understand the full picture:

The chart plots “patch” vs. “average FPS”; higher numbers are better.
Each line represents a common hardware configuration (CPU+GPU pairing) from among our player base. When analyzing performance data, we consider this pairing to be the most important predictor for expected performance. Machines with the same CPU+GPU pairing are aggregated together in these charts.
The data samples are taken from two queues: Unrated and Competitive. Since these are the most popular game modes in VALORANT, we spend a great deal of effort to understand and improve performance in these areas.
We’ve excluded games that don’t have exactly 10 players. This ensures outliers don’t skew the data (games with fewer players perform better).
SUMMARY OF GLOBAL INVALIDATION
global-invalidation-summary-flow.jpg

Global Invalidation delivers up to 15% gains for CPU-bound clients (generally mid to high spec machines). Realizing these gains was an effort that spanned multiple teams and took many months to complete. Our process for identifying areas of the game ripe for optimization paid off, and managing risk along the way helped ensure a stable experience for players.

WHO BENEFITS, AND CALIBRATING EXPECTATIONS
Based on our live metrics, Global Invalidation has delivered up to <X>% improvement for client configurations that are CPU-bound (generally mid to high spec machines).

While the upward trend is noticeable in the aggregate, it doesn’t represent moment-to-moment gameplay. Additionally, it doesn’t guarantee that every machine with matching hardware will see identical results.

This means the baseline performance for VALORANT on CPU-bound machines has generally increased, but exactly how your specific machine will perform is dependent on a number of other factors unique to you.

UNDERSTANDING GLOBAL INVALIDATION
Before we can properly give an overview of Global Invalidation, we first need to explain a bit about UI elements in the Unreal Engine.

WIDGETS AND TREE STRUCTURES
UI elements (also known as Widgets) are created from smaller building blocks using a tree structure. The tree structure is analogous to the file system on your computer. A Widget can have any number of children (just like a folder can have any number of files).

These building blocks can be combined to create complex Widgets. Our ammo counter, for example, consists of many parts, and the tree looks something like the following:

Screenshot_2022-03-07_at_16-30-57_PRF_-_Global_Invalidation_article.png

Putting it all together, the ammo counter building blocks look like the following:

AskVal_March22_Valorant_UI_Elements.jpg

(The green outlines above are exaggerated for clarity. In practice, many of the outlines would overlap.)

Whenever one or more Widgets change within the tree structure, it can affect multiple other Widgets. For example, if a Widget moves to a new position on screen, all Widgets underneath need to recalculate their position as well. These changes are managed by a system called “Invalidation,” which we’ll talk about in the next section.

INVALIDATION
Invalidation is the mechanism the Unreal Engine uses to indicate when a particular Widget has changed and needs to be updated.

A Widget needs to be invalidated for a variety of reasons: animation, color, opacity, size, ordering, text, images, and many other properties can change in response to something that happens in the game. When these changes happen to a Widget, it’s “Invalidated,” signaling that it needs to be updated.

Complicating this process a bit more, a Widget can have multiple types of invalidation. A few types include:

Layout - When the size of a Widget changes (very expensive).
Paint - When the look of the Widget has changed, but hasn’t changed size.
Child Order - When the order of Widgets has changed within the tree (also implies Layout, and is therefore expensive).
Visibility - When the visibility of a Widget has changed, either becoming invisible or becoming visible (also implies Layout, and is therefore expensive).
These types of invalidation are used to signify what kinds of operations must be performed to draw it properly.

It gets even more complicated when one Widget depends on another Widget. Widgets are organized into hierarchies, and their layout is dependent on a number of factors. Invalidating a single Widget may require invalidating a number of related Widgets to properly draw. For example, if multiple Widgets are organized into a vertical layout (e.g. the Social Panel with your friends list), and the order of Widgets changes (e.g. a friend comes online), all Widgets within the vertical layout need to be updated.

There are several goals with a system like this:

Invalidate as few Widgets as possible. This reduces the number of Widgets that have to be updated in order to draw properly.
Only invalidate a Widget when necessary. Improperly invalidating a Widget wastes precious CPU cycles.
When a Widget isn’t invalidated, cache the result to quickly draw it every frame. If nothing changes, then CPU cycles can be saved.
That’s enough of a look under-the-hood to understand how Widgets update and what kinds of things can cause invalidation. Next, we’ll look at how developers put this into practice.

INVALIDATION BOXES
Unreal Engine provides a component—called an Invalidation Box—to group multiple Widgets together. All Widgets contained within a single Invalidation Box are prevented from getting pre-passed, ticked, or painted. Instead, the result is cached into a vertex buffer.

Whenever one of the Widgets within the Invalidation Box is invalidated, the cached data is discarded and the Widget gets updated and painted again. While refreshing the cache may be expensive for a single frame, the amortized result is far better in the long run.

Invalidation Boxes are a key part of making VALORANT’s UI performant, especially as we worked toward launch. However, they’re not entirely free:

Developers need to understand which Widgets are good candidates for grouping together with an Invalidation Box. Any Widget that updates regularly isn’t suited for this.
Placing Widgets within an Invalidation Box takes manual work on the part of a developer. It’s not feasible to do for every Widget in the game, and therefore developers must also understand which Widgets are worth putting into an Invalidation Box.
To read more about Invalidation Boxes, check out Epic’s documentation.

Now we have enough context to talk about Global Invalidation!

ENTER GLOBAL INVALIDATION
By this point you may be thinking to yourself, “Why not just put every UI element into a global Invalidation Box?” Well, that’s precisely what Global Invalidation does (more or less).

Global Invalidation aims to significantly improve UI performance across the whole game while also reducing manual work required of developers to place Widgets in individual Invalidation Boxes. It’s the best of all worlds.

However, as of UE4.25 (the version of the Unreal Engine that VALORANT uses), Global Invalidation isn’t universally supported for all Widget types. Later versions of the Unreal Engine have made improvements, but VALORANT couldn’t take advantage of that right away. Additionally, we didn’t have a great understanding for how much faster Global Invalidation would make VALORANT.

Here’s where our work began.

WHY DID WE DECIDE TO DO THIS WORK?
In late July of 2021, the team decided to take Global Invalidation for a testrun during an internal playtest. Minor changes were made to fix a few bugs so the playtest could successfully complete. However, we knew bugs would surface during the playtest… and we certainly found bugs.

By the end of the playtest, we’d collected around 20 bugs—and those were just the obvious ones. It was likely more subtle, insidious bugs were waiting to be found, not to mention several edge cases that hadn’t been specifically tested.

But… did Global Invalidation deliver performance gains? It absolutely did.

Analyzing the data generated from that single playtest, it was determined that UI was ~35% faster. (Note: UI is only part of the cost for a single frame.)

However, we still had many open questions:

How much time is needed to fix all of the bugs?
Which team(s) should be responsible for the work?
Does this take priority over other planned work? To meet regular content releases, our schedules are often set months in advance and emergent work–even something as exciting as this–is hard to fit in the schedule.
Would fixing the bugs take away from the performance gains? Fixing all of the bugs would require many code changes, each of which has the potential to cause UI to become more expensive.
When should we do this work? Knowing that Global Invalidation was being actively developed in later Unreal Engine versions meant we needed to consider our timeline for integrating changes from Epic.
Ultimately, we decided the work was worthwhile for a couple reasons.

UNREAL ENGINE INTEGRATIONS AND TIMING CONSIDERATIONS
Although Unreal Engine 4.26 and 4.27 have made significant progress on Global Invalidation, VALORANT works on a delayed integration schedule. The reason we don’t work on the “bleeding edge” is to manage risk and ensure stability for our players.

Since our schedule meant we would stay on Unreal Engine 4.25 for many more months, this meant players wouldn’t get to benefit from these performance gains for well over a year. That didn’t sit well with us.

For more details on how VALORANT thinks about Unreal Engine upgrades, check out this Twitter thread from VALORANT’s Tech Lead, Marcus Reid.

KNOWN PERFORMANCE GAINS
Global Invalidation represented something really unique in terms of performance work: measured value. We measured the potential gains during an internal playtest, and the path to deliver that value was (mostly) clear.

Performance work is difficult. It’s a game of inches, not miles; incremental changes help generally improve performance over time, and it’s rare to find a single change capable of delivering double-digit gains. This was too juicy of an optimization to leave on the table.

Even after accounting for diminished gains due to bug fixes, Global Invalidation was the best chance for us to deliver significant gains for players within a reasonable amount of time.

HOW DID WE ACCOMPLISH THIS WORK?
Although initial experimentation around Global Invalidation began in late July 2021, earnest effort on stabilizing the feature didn’t start until late September 2021.

SELECTIVELY INTEGRATING EPIC’S CHANGES
Fully integrating Unreal Engine 4.26 and 4.27 was off the table, but since we knew Epic had actively worked on Global Invalidation, we decided to dig through thousands of changes and identify which changes were likely to get us closer to a stable, fully-functioning Global Invalidation.

Partially integrating changes was a challenging task. It was important to modify as few core engine features as possible to maintain stability while pulling in the right changes from Epic. All of this work was done in a separate branch from the main VALORANT branch to prevent impacting other developers.

After selectively integrating Epic’s changes into our engine, we spent several more weeks fixing as many bugs as possible while we prepared to introduce Global Invalidation into the main VALORANT branch. Along the way a toggle was created to let us quickly enable and disable the feature (should anything catastrophic occur).

With many bugs fixed, and with many of Epic’s changes from 4.26 and 4.27, we merged from our isolated branch back into the main branch.

FINDING COMMONALITIES BETWEEN BUGS
Although many of the bugs with Global Invalidation manifested in different ways, the root cause could often be traced back to a single issue. These were the most valuable bugs to fix, as doing so could eliminate multiple issues with a single change. One change, for example, fixed 10+ bugs that were scattered throughout the game. Careful analysis of the root problem led to robust solutions that improved the reliability and stability of Global Invalidation.

IDENTIFY BUGS, FIX BUGS, PLAYTEST, RINSE AND REPEAT
The following weeks and months involved a regular cycle of enabling Global Invalidation before a playtest, identifying a series of bugs, disabling Global Invalidation after the playtest, and fixing those bugs.

developer-bug-fix-flow.jpg


Fewer bugs were reported with each iteration of the loop. We continued doing this until the steady stream of bugs turned into a slow drip, and eventually stopped.

By the end of November 2021, all of the major issues were resolved and Global Invalidation was largely stable.

NOTABLE BUGS
Astra crashes the game - At one point, every Astra player was greeted with a crash upon loading into the game. This bug was fixed after integrating changes from Epic.
Multiple inheritance crash - Multiple inheritance in C++ is a tricky subject. Without getting too far into the weeds, the order of destructors in a particular class did not execute in the right order, causing a crash. Simply swapping 2 lines of code to change the inheritance order fixed the problem. To read more about multiple inheritance, check out this page.
Infinite chat audio - While in the menus, the chat bar plays a sound when you hover over it with the mouse. To the annoyance of everyone, a bug caused that audio to play multiple times a second. Fixing this bug involved understanding the timing of how Widgets receive mouse events multiple times a frame.
TESTING METHODOLOGIES
One element of Global Invalidation that made us particularly cautious (and therefore thorough with our testing) is that it affects every aspect of the game. Literally.

Your friends list? Absolutely. The button you press to queue up? That too. The settings menu? You betcha. My headshot percentage? Well…

The point is that UI elements exist throughout the game, and they often convey critical information to players. Breaking even one of those UI elements was unacceptable.

To that end, our QA department created a testing plan with multiple strategies to build confidence that Global Invalidation was working as intended.

VERTICAL SLICE TESTING
A “vertical slice” of VALORANT represents the main path players generally take, from launching the client, to queuing up for a match, to playing a full game, to interacting with the end-of-game screen. By focusing on the critical elements of the game, QA could quickly test the most used elements of the game and identify problems early.

DESTRUCTIVE TESTING
Where vertical slice testing leaves off, destructive testing picks up. This type of testing is intended to identify off-nominal issues, often by modifying external factors (such as network ping, frame rate, alt-tabbing, etc.). Armed with a set of internal tools, QA spent several weeks doing destructive testing.

EDGE CASE TESTING
Many parts of VALORANT are only experienced by a small percentage of the player base. Some parts of the game are only ever experienced once (e.g. the New Player Experience). Just because those parts of the game are less traversed, it doesn’t make them less important. Identifying and testing all of our edge cases helped catch hidden errors.

PBE (PUBLIC BETA ENVIRONMENT) TESTING
PBE was a major milestone for Global Invalidation.

It was the first time outside players could test the feature. This meant that Global Invalidation could be tested under “real world” conditions.
PBE represents a variety of hardware specifications. PBE intentionally covers the range from low to high specs, and testing with such a large range of player devices helped us build confidence in how well Global Invalidation would perform across the wider player base.
After testing on PBE during the weekend of Jan. 22, 2022 - Jan. 23, 2022, we had confidence that Global Invalidation didn’t interfere with integrity and that performance gains were in line with our predictions.

RELEASING GLOBAL INVALIDATION
After launching Global Invalidation with Patch 4.03, we closely monitored player reports for bugs. We also kept a close eye on the performance data to confirm our estimations matched the results. In the end, Global Invalidation was a huge success for players, and we hope you enjoy the improved frame time.

Now that Global Invalidation is out in the world, the Performance team is going back to work on delivering even more gains. Until next time, happy fragging!
Hey, it’s David ‘Milkcow’ Cole, VALORANT game designer. We shipped a game! We have a live game! And with going live to you, we now have a responsibility to maintain the live experience— most importantly—game balance.

From as far back as our Alpha, there has been a group of Content Designers, QA, and Insights setting up the foundations of game balance and health, so that when we hit the live phase of VALORANT (that’s now), we would have a rough understanding of what is healthy, overpowered, underpowered, etc. Hopefully this article will shed some light into how we’ve been approaching balance and where we want to end up.

BALANCE DO’S AND DON’TS
Game balance is something that every player feels and may have some opinions about. The experiences all of you have and feel shape your perceptions of the game—your perception is your truth. It’s our job to provide an experience that is fair for every player. With that being said, here’s what we will and won’t do:

We’ll prioritize audiences that we think take the game in the right direction in its current state. We’ll have to make tradeoffs with which audience we’re aiming to balance for—it won't be every player
We won’t make every player happy with our changes. Sometimes we’ll need to make or not make changes that go against what our players want for the greater game.
We’ll rely on human judgement to contextualize game data. We won’t be entirely data driven.
We won’t seek a perfect 50/50 balance. When everything is 50/50 across the board the decisions per session become less meaningful—you could say.. robotic and formulaic. The human element of making decisions provides decision points that players can weigh the tradeoffs of.
We’re holding true to our guiding principles—what we call “the tac cycle.” No matter what, the game must uphold the values of the tac cycle in order to be healthy.

Balance_Tac_Cycle_Image.jpg
A quick breakdown of the tac cycle: Intel → Plan → Execute → Repeat.

Intel
Who and where are your opponents?
What has taken place up to the current state of the game?
What territory of the map do we own? Do the opponents own?
Which Agents, abilities and guns are in play?
What have your opponents done previously?
Plan
With the information we’ve gathered from intel what is my plan?
Execute
Timing
Coordinating to implement the plan
Abilities
Critical part of reducing the risk of your plan
Shooting
Click heads to close out engagements.
VALORANT is a game where every decision in this loop matters. You are aware of the decisions you’ve made and their outcomes. You can have the perfect intel and plan, but mechanically fail to execute. You can have no plan, yet win by mechanically executing the impossible. Your skill matters.

It's important that this loop happens for every player at every level of play. It starts when you find a match and your map is shown, the characters you pick as a composition, the round you're about to play, and when you’re in that 1v2 clutch on B site.

BALANCE RADAR
Our group has been working to set up a process for how we make decisions and gather information over the last 6 months—kind of like building our own balance radar. This has consisted of creating a process of diverse information inputs.

Balance_Inputs_Process_Image.jpg
On the balance group, we have three primary sources of information that we take in to inform our decisions. Each of them are incredibly important to help to determine whether the live state of the game is healthy or whether we need to intervene and nudge it back on track.

Game Data: These are data that tell us what’s actually happening in the game on any given patch - match winrates, defender/attacker round winrates, agent pickrates, weapon purchase rates, etc. It paints the picture for us from which to make decisions.

Sentiment Data: While we are committed to ensuring VALORANT is a balanced game for our players, we also want to make sure that we’re creating an experience that is enjoyable for players overall. To ensure we’re meeting our goals here, we send player surveys periodically to understand how they feel about the current state of the game: what’s fun, what’s frustrating, etc. This helps us interpret game data, but also lets us understand if there are experience issues that aren’t represented in the game data.

Design Philosophy: Finally, the balance team leverages its own design philosophy when making decisions to drive the game towards what we feel is the right direction. Ultimately, game and sentiment data help us understand the state of the game and our playerbase on any given patch, but our design philosophy fundamentally informs how we feel about that state—it defines the goals we’re aiming to hit.
During our time together as a balance group, we’ve used a combination of game data, sentiment data, and our design philosophy to align on a set of “bounds.” Think of them as borders—when our metrics live inside the borders, we feel the game is fairly healthy. If something dips outside of these borders, it raises a flag and we investigate. We’re not ready to share the numbers of these bounds yet, but the graph below has an example of how we think about bounds on different types of content.

These are examples of statements, not true facts!

ALERTS

Agent overall

Agent by map

Agent by side

Start side winrate

Round side winrate

Upper bounds

“Sage is busted”

“Raze on Split is too strong”

“Cypher is too good on defense”

“If I start on attack on Split I have a higher chance of winning the match”

“Split is too defender-sided”

Lower bounds

“Viper is trash”

“Jett is bad on Bind”

“Cypher can’t do anything on offense”

Weapons. Where do I begin? Weapons are incredibly complex when contextualized in-game. The data itself does not tell you the story of their impact and we’re still figuring out the exact details of them.

Another part of this process is developing a voice and communicating our changes and reasons in patch notes:

.47+
.49
.50
1.0
1.01
And lastly, we embed ourselves into the ecosystem. We have people on the team playing at a high level, communicating with key individuals for feedback and constantly reading any feedback we can get.

CASE STUDY: RAZE
Here’s an example of how all the above pieces come together: Raze was released as strong vs other Agents and lots of vocal sentiment grew about her existence in VALORANT.

This is how the team used the steps above to get to our changelist for Raze in the .47+ patch.

Excal, Morello, and the rest of our balance group were aligned that Raze’s kit fits the tac cycle and did not break the loop. She was one of our first kits that this project had designed, and she had helped shape the cycle itself.
We immediately looked at the data. She had a high match win rate of ~51% and 53.5% in non-mirrored matches, especially on defense against enemies that were grouped up charging her position. This did not trigger our initial alerts that we had set in Closed Beta. We quickly realized that power in our game was in the measures of .1%’s rather than 1%’s. We tightened the bands later on as the conversations internally around Raze were that she was OP relative to other Agents.
We looked at player sentiment. Streams, surveys, anecdotes, forums—anything we could find. There was a lot of frustration about being rocketed and naded but when we dug into it, we realized that players were not reacting to the audio cues of her abilities and had a hard time understanding what was happening to them outside of the fact that they were now dead.
Excal did an analysis writeup with the information we had acquired and proposed some changes:
Having two grenades that she could throw back to back created an oppressive scenario for players trying to push into her. Raze players were getting a lot of kills which in turn gave her access to her Ultimate more often.
Players were not reacting to the counterplay cues of her abilities which caused more frustration.
We made changes and tested them internally.
Grenade charges went from 2 to 1 and became a reset on kill. This change lowered the frequency in which opponents would run into the nades but still give the Raze player the opportunity to continually blow stuff up. It was a great change that fit her core identity—kill them.
The audio attenuation of her Rocket fire and equip were changed drastically to really tell players that they needed to vacate the area.
We put them into the patch notes and added context to our reasonings.
We monitored the player's reaction and sentiment to the patch notes. They liked the direction we were taking her but were still skeptical about Raze in general. Her win rate directly took a hit but not by much. Yet, the perception was that she is in a much more balanced state.
We followed up in later patches using the direction we had set in .47+.
There have been countless amounts of iteration on all of these pieces above to get them to where they are today and we’ll continue to evolve these as we learn how you're playing VALORANT.

Thank you for reading my Dave Talk and if you enjoyed reading, there’s more to come in the future!
With the recent release of our DUALITY cinematic, I wanted to talk about where it sits within the wider VALORANT Universe, answer a few popular questions, and give tease where we’re headed.

It's been a year since we launched VALORANT! I think it’s safe to say it’s been a wild year for all of you as well. Now, take a moment to reflect and go back in time with me to the moment that VALORANT launched.

DUELIST, introduced two of our Agents, Phoenix & Jett, in a high stakes chase across the rooftops of a European city, for control over a mysterious “package.”


At the conclusion, we witnessed the IGNITION of this package, creating a significant reality distorting effect on a major city, triggering battles across the globe.

Our latest cinematic, DUALITY, starts where DUELIST left off and sheds light on VALORANT’s underlying conflict.

The day after IGNITION, the world is in shock. VALORANT PROTOCOL—a covert operation set up to prevent just such disasters—scrambles to make sense of the unfolding events. Analysis of Venice and the remnants of the package suggests the detonation of a device harnessing the power of Radianite, previously thought to be a clean and safe source of energy.

VALORANT Agents locate another of these devices at a Kingdom site in Morocco. When placed into the ground, this “Spike” goes through its activation sequence. With short time, can our Agents work together to neutralize the device, and prevent another disaster?

Can they overcome their biggest foes, which turn out to be...themselves?


As the Creative Director on VALORANT, I help make sure that we present a distinct and cohesive universe that sets up a central conflict, stakes, and goals that map the experience and stakes for you. I work with all our teams to ensure the content we release feels connected and that over time, reveals more and more about the VALORANT universe, in and outside the game.

“Narrative Dissonance,” is a term in videogame development that is used to describe games that have characters and a story that feel out of step with the actual gameplay.

For example, think of a game with deep lore, sophisticated backstories, and then you jump into the game and you smash each other or shoot each other. Believe me, it’s not necessarily a problem, some of my favorite games get along fine and they're amazing!

However, we wanted to do something special for VALORANT that would add dimension to the lore. Could we ground our 5v5 defend/attack conflict, between the ‘same’ pool of Agents experienced in the playspace, and craft a central conflict in which it would make sense?

This is all to say, I’m excited to peel back the layers more, as we explore this theme of Duality and ponder these questions together:

Who are these ‘mirror’ Agents?
Are they two sides of the same coin?
Why is one side seemingly acting as the aggressor?
What is the meaning of that final shot of Earth that seems almost split in two?
We are one year in but the journey is just beginning. We can’t wait to share more with you over the next year as we answer more of your questions and no doubt pose new ones!
We’re Sara (Producer, aka “Riot necrotix”) and Lea (Strategist, aka “Riot aeneia”), part of the crew that leads the Social and Player Dynamics team (S&PD) on VALORANT.

Our team owns all the social features in-game, and we work together with other teams to address issues and opportunities with player behavior. Last year, we promised to address some of the pain points you’ve experienced in-game with other players.

Today is our long-awaited update: We’ve taken all of your feedback to heart, and we are at the point where we can confidently share what we’ve been up to.

Before we dig in, we want to acknowledge the obvious: we still have a lot of work ahead of us. These changes are just the start, but they set the stage for the work we’ll continue to deliver in the months and years ahead. We hope you're as excited about it as we are.

Now, let's get started:

AFKs (Target Patch: 2.04)

Over the past several months, we’ve focused much of our efforts on a problem we know is painful to you: AFKs. Even one AFK’d player can turn the tide of a game, and it’s discouraging to know that you’ll have to carry twice as hard for a chance to win. We’ve spent some time working on several features we’re confident will reduce AFKs (both in-game and pre-game) in VALORANT.

We’re implementing improved detection of AFK-type behavior.

Our old system had a few loopholes, and it sucked to see some players slipping through the cracks. Those loopholes will be patched, and in the future, we’ll broaden this detection to encompass other types of disruptive behavior and non-participatory play.

(We can’t go into too much detail on the specifics of this, but know that we have vastly improved our system, and we will continue to iterate on it as new types of exploits turn up in the game.)

We’ve completely revamped our penalty structure for AFK offenses.

Rather than apply generic penalties on an “as needed” basis, we’ll track the behavior of your account over time. This means that your occasional “what the heck happened to my internet” moment likely won’t be punished too harsh (if at all).

On the other hand, if you’re a player who consistently drops out of games...the hammer will come down on you, friend. These penalties are varied, and they scale based on several different factors.

Penalties can include the following:

Warnings
XP denial for the games in which you were AFK’d (see ya later, AFK farmers!)
Small deductions from your ranked rating for pre-game dodges
Deductions from your ranked rating for in-game AFKing (Patch 2.03)
Increased queue restrictions
Barred entry from ranked games
VALORANT game bans (but only if you’re really, really persistent)
Simply put, we’ve leveled up our detection and management of AFKs. And we’re eager to bring these to your game.

CHAT-BASED OFFENSES (Target Patch: 2.04)

We’ve been heads down for a while, and there’s a good reason for that. In addition to AFK’s, we’ve been hard at work improving your experience of communicating with other players in-game.

Say goodbye to “comms bans for all.” To date, we’ve released text moderation for over 11 languages, and we’ve revamped our penalty system for text-based offenses. We’ve introduced more nuance to the system, and penalties escalate with both the frequency and severity of the offense.

Penalties can include the following:

Warnings
Comms bans
Extended comms bans
Ranked queue bans
Game bans
Extended game bans
(Don't forget: tentatively aimed for Patch 2.04, players who are comms banned will be barred from Competitive queue.)

Let us be crystal clear: there is no room for violence, threats, or targeted harassment in VALORANT—those behaviors will not be tolerated. Certain offenses (like those listed above) are categorized as “zero tolerance,” and they warrant a game ban, full stop.

That said, we want to give you a fair warning: our current text evaluation systems can’t discern who started the rage war. If we see you saying awful things, you’ll get flagged, no matter who threw it down first. If someone is verbally harassing you, do not harass them back or repeat what they have said. Report them, and trust that our systems will take care of it. (You also have the option of muting their text chat, voice chat, and pings). We don’t want you getting punished for someone else’s wrongdoing.

REPORTER FEEDBACK (Target Patch: 2.05)

Along with all the above, we’re rolling out feedback to your reports. With this feature, players will be notified when their reports have been actioned on.

We understand it's frustrating to send a report and not know if we ever even saw it, let alone took action on it. Believe us that we’re listening, and your reports do matter—in fact, they’re absolutely essential in making sure we know what you’ve experienced. Version 1 of this will require you to be logged into the game client to receive the feedback, but we’re on our way to a system where we can notify you outside the game.

Ultimately, we just want you to know that we take these issues as seriously as you feel about them, and we are not afraid to punt the bad actors out of our game. We have a long journey ahead of us, but we are thrilled to work with you on making VALORANT a great social experience for all.

ON THE HORIZON

These types of detections (and associated penalties) will come to voice comms as well. In the meantime, please continue to report offending players until we finalize our tech.

Once we extinguish the fires of problematic play, we want to spend more time exploring the brighter side of our VALORANT players: “pro-social” gameplay.

We’re investigating ways to detect positive behavior, and to give players visibility and recognition for their pro-social play. As a little added bonus, we’re introducing a new feature which allows you to invite players to games with only their Riot ID (rather than having to add them as a friend first). This will give you the chance to test out new teammates, without the commitment of adding them to your friends list.

We hope you’ll discover new friends to play through this feature.

WRAP THIS UP

Thank you! Thank you for your feedback, for your patience, and for your unending enthusiasm and dedication to the game we all love. While we’re proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish so far, there’s clearly plenty more work to be done. These are just a few steps on a much longer journey. We’re dedicated to making VALORANT the social experience you deserve, and we’re looking forward to working on that goal together.

With that, we’ll include some helpful links if you want more information on any of the topics we’ve just discussed. We’ll chat with you all soon :)
Hi I’m Brian Chang, an analyst on VALORANT’s Insights team, here with Insights Researcher Coleman “Altombre” Palm. We’re here to talk to you about our approach to using data to help keep our game balanced and enjoyable for you.

In this article, we’ll first cover our general philosophy behind how we use data to help inform changes to our game. We’ll then walk you through an example that shows how past data was used to inform changes to an Agent.

DATA IN GAME BALANCE PHILOSOPHY
On the balance team, our primary goal is to make sure that the game is a fair experience for every player. You can read David “MILKCOW” Cole’s insightful post on game balance in VALORANT here.

One of the major roles that data plays during the game balance process is to help inform designers about the state of the game. Data can tell us when your experience appears to be in a non-ideal state.

Data in this case is used as a diagnostic tool to tell us which parts of our game might need tuning. This data could come in the form of in-game telemetry (e.g. a particular Agent’s winrate is too high/low), or it could come in the form of player research (e.g. a majority of players view an Agent to be frustrating to play against).

However, we go out of our way to not be completely data-driven when making balance decisions in the game, especially early on. VALORANT is still relatively fresh in your hands, and we ourselves don’t yet fully know what “balanced” looks like in our game.

For example, we don’t know how far away from 50/50 attacker/defender-favored a map has to be before player experience becomes unfun. Furthermore, there’s complexity in the fact that Agent strength and popularity affects map balance. A Sentinel-heavy meta would likely lead to more defender-sided maps, whereas a Duelist-heavy meta would likely make maps seem more attacker-favored (things get even messier if you think about how Agents affect maps on a map-by-map basis). Data won’t be the “be-all and end-all” of game balance, but rather one of the many tools we can use to understand the state of the game.

That being said, we’re constantly monitoring both our in-game data as well as your direct input via surveys, so that we can refine our understanding of how data correlates to in-game states of balance. Our aspiration is that in the future, this refined understanding will help us more rapidly understand what aspects of the game seem off, and how we can adjust.

WHAT WE’RE TRACKING
Today, we have a number of data points we look at for each part of our game in order to assess the strength/health of various parts of our game. Split by system, here are some of the metrics we track:

Agents: Winrate (by rank, map), presence (how often an agent is picked), mastery curves (how many games of an agent it takes for a player to hit the “true” winrate of that agent), breadth vs. depth (broad popularity of an agent vs. how deeply each player engages with an agent)
Maps: Round winrate by side (by rank), average round outcome by map (if/where spike was planted)
Weapons: Weapon popularity by round, weapon matchups (e.g. how well a Vandal user does against a Phantom user in a duel)
This isn’t to say that we use only the above metrics to assess the health of our game, but hopefully the examples give you a picture of some of the things we track.

Agent Balance: A Sage case study

For the rest of this post, we’ll focus on Sage, an Agent who has been on the nerfing block quite a few times since our June launch. What led to us making continued changes to Sage, and how did those changes affect her strength?

WHICH AGENT IS TOO STRONG?
The first thing we need to establish is what metrics we use to assess Agent strength. In League of Legends, the primary metrics that are used are presence (how often a champion is picked) and winrate (% of games won per champion). This gets split into a number of different skill brackets, ranging from the average player all the way to the pro level.

Immediately, we observed a major issue when trying to apply League’s metrics for balance in VALORANT. Our game has mirror matches, so an Agent that is very strong (or generally picked in almost all games) could appear to have a 50% winrate (since every time that Agent wins, they also lose).

To resolve this issue, we decided to look at an Agent’s non-mirror winrate (that is, an Agent’s winrate when going against a team without that Agent on the enemy team). This helps us remove the “guaranteed win AND loss” games where the same Agent is on either team. There are some potential risks to this (some amount of selection bias is introduced, which we won’t get into now), but we determined that this non-mirror winrate was our best proxy to understand an Agent’s power from an in-game data perspective.

Here’s what non-mirror winrates looked like in the first patch with Competitive queue live (in patch 1.02). Keep in mind that Sage was nerfed twice before this patch, in Closed Beta patch 0.50 as well as launch patch 1.00. 

valorant_graph_1.jpg
During that same time, here’s what presence looked like for Agents in competitive queues. Some amount of this is related to the fact Sage was one of five free agents when a player joins VALORANT, but her presence was still consistently very high. 

valorant_graph_2.jpg
WHY IS AN AGENT STRONG?
It was clear from the data that Sage was in a tier of her own. The winrate numbers Sage was putting up merited further discussion about what we could do to tone her down.

So far, the data had told us which Agent was too strong. But we wanted to better understand why she was so strong. There are a number of data points we could look at to understand why:

Direct feedback from you about why you believe Sage is strong, both in surveys and in direct conversations
Breakouts of Agent strength by side (to understand how much of Sage’s strengths are pronounced on attack/defense)
Breakout of Agent strength/presence by rank (to understand if there are discrepancies across skill brackets)
Ability-specific data (average amount of healing Sage does in a round, round winrate when Sage uses her ultimate, compared to when other agents use their ultimate, etc.)
All of these data points are intended to give more context on what components of Sage are strong and potentially overtuned. The tricky part is to make sure that we nerf an Agent without compromising their identity as a part of VALORANT. If we nerf the strongest part of every Agent, we risk losing what makes them special. Equipped with this data, our designers explored options to make Sage not a “must-pick”, while keeping her identity as a premium stall/support utility character. 

It’s important to keep in mind that data is but one of the tools that can be used to assess Agent strength. A huge part of understanding and refining an Agent’s kit is more related to the vast amount of knowledge and experience that the designers bring to the table. Our design philosophy is ultimately what drives our game forward, and no amount of data is useful unless we keep our core design principles at the forefront of game balance.

Ultimately, the direction that the balance team ended up going is to hit both her healing and stalling, but in different ways. Healing potential was cut across the board (longer cooldown, less healing per cast), while stalling was changed to allow for more counterplay (Barrier Orb took some time to fortify, Slow Orb size reduction).

WHAT THINGS LOOK LIKE TODAY
So after we made those changes, what do things look like? Here’s what Sage’s numbers looked like in patch 1.11 competitive queues: 

valorant_graph_3.jpg
valorant_graph_4.jpg
Sage is still quite strong; in fact, she has never fallen outside of the top three strongest at any point, in any skill bracket, since launch. Her presence is in a more reasonable state as well (hovering around 50%). However, public perception is that Sage was nerfed too hard; 38% surveyed believe that Sage is currently too weak in patch 1.11.

valorant_graph_5.jpg
MOVING AHEAD
Currently, we feel like Sage is in a relatively healthy state, according to our data. There are, however, a number of factors that we’ll need to refine our understanding on moving forward:

Release of Agents, maps, and how those affect Agent strength: With the release of Icebox and (more importantly) Skye, we may see a shift in the meta such that Sage becomes too weak. Hypothetically, the introduction of another Agent that can heal allies might provide choice competition that renders Sage more obsolete (for the record, we don’t think this will happen, but it’s possible).
Pro-play data: One thing that we’re still refining in our understanding of the pro-play meta, and how data from the highest level of VALORANT should affect our balance philosophy. If we compare the data from the professional matches happening around the world to Radiant-level matches, there’s still a huge discrepancy in both Agent presence and non-mirror winrates.
Public perception: Despite our in-game telemetry telling us that Sage is in a good spot balance-wise, survey results tell us that players feel like Sage feels too weak. We’ll have to track how perception changes (if at all) over time, and assess what steps need to be taken should perception remain dubious about Sage’s strength.
If you made it this far, thanks for sticking with us through this small example of how data is used over on the VALORANT balance team. We hope this gave you some visibility into how and why decisions are made (and hopefully can convince you that Sage isn’t completely useless…).
The Battlepass is a path of various rewards for the time you spend tapping heads and planting Spikes in VALORANT. It’s a feature all players engage with, so we (the Premium Content team) want to make sure the pass is broadly appealing. That doesn’t mean every player will love everything; however, every player should love at least something.

We draw inspiration from lots of sources—the Maps, meta gameplay memes, fun references to items from the previous Battlepass, etc.—and go into each creative brainstorm with an open mind.

Although this dev diary will focus on creative considerations behind the Battlepass, improvements for our cosmetics are always top of mind. The recent pick-any-variant change, experimenting with melee variants, and taking an honest look at the work needed for skin level toggling are recent examples. You can also look ahead to Act III Battlepass for upcoming changes driven by your feedback. Keep that coming


THERE’S LEVELS TO THIS
chicken.png	PlayerCards_SchematicVandal_L1.png	tactibear.png

From the start, the Battlepass was built with a free track so free-to-players can also earn rewards and commemorate their participation with a feeling of “I was there!”

There are also some rewards that we couldn’t imagine not letting everyone earn, such as the Tactibear Buddy, or the ultimate Chicken spray/title/card combo, to name a few. Look, you all need some way to show your Vandal love or celebrate your opponents’ salty tears.

For players who purchase the Premium track—our aim is to create a diverse array of options for cosmetics. Something scifi, fantasy, sci-fantasy (yes…), artsy, edgy, etc. This is especially important because we know there are a lot of you who never purchase skins in the Store directly but still want to earn lots of in-game items.

(That’s why in Act III, we’re also offering variant upgrades for the Surge skin, since many Battlepass-only players had tons of Radianite Points in the bank but no way to spend them.)

opcrimson.png	PlayerCards_GTease_L1.png	coffee.png

The tier order changes every Act so that the most popular cosmetics aren't always artificially locked until the last few tiers. That way, if you’re the type of player who only buys the Battlepass, you can find a skin for your favorite weapon regardless if you completed all 50 tiers or not.

For example, in Act I the Vandal skin was in Chapter 9, but in Act II, it showed up much earlier. We want players to feel like they’ve earned something special as they level up through the Battlepass, but we also gotta be fair.

WHAT’S THE IDEA?
A smiling toaster. A record player, but with a VALORANT spin. A griefing Scuttle Crab. Froggie Hat. Where does this all come from?

toaster.png	vinyl.png	froggy.png
FUN ON COMPANY TIME
How do we come up with ideas for what to put in the Battlepass? Whatever insane creative process you’ve pictured in your head is probably close to the truth. A small team of us brainstorm (virtually, these days) big, no-constraints, blue-sky ideas for hours.

Believe us, there’s no such thing as a bad idea so early in the creative process. Similar to our weapon skins approach, we encourage wild ideas and a safe place to pitch them. Our team can always narrow the final ideas later, but at this stage we optimize for quantity rather than quality of ideas. If it’s just too big for our team to tackle at the moment, we save it for later.

THEME SONGS
Because the Battlepass content is exclusive to the Act it’s released in, we want to make sure the content feels like it feels like a cohesive package. Step one is to look at what else is happening in that Act:

Who’s the new Agent getting released?
Are there any new maps?
Are there any global events or holidays happening?
What do we want to tease about the lore of VALORANT?
What’s the current meta?
What are players saying about VALORANT lately?
Melee_hive.png	Vandal_hive.png	ares_hive.png

NO DREAMS, ONLY TIERS NOW
It’s no surprise that we strive for thematic diversity within the Battlepass skins. This can start with a nebulous intent, such as a desire for a pure fantasy design. Take the Act III Battlepass: the Ruin collection leans into the fantasy genre, whereas Surge is more clean and graphic, and Serenity is aimed at the luxurious.

guardian_ruin.png	bucky_charge.png	phantom_serenity.png

It also helps when you tell us what you loved from previous Battlepasses. The popularity of Tactibear led to the creation of their peer, Tactisquirrel. Many of you equipped the Octopus Player Card, so we started to lean heavily into Octopus-related content.

The content should also be relevant and topical to the VALORANT community. For example, the seemingly ongoing debate of “which is better, the Vandal or the Phantom” may never be solved, so we wanted to commemorate that argument with a card. 

(A card memeing on the unfortunate abundance of Guardian skins is overdue.) 

For holidays, we try to capture the spirit rather than something more abstract. A cute jack-o-lantern Gun Buddy is alright, but too much spooky content probably isn’t something our global audience would appreciate.

And then there’s something we can all relate to, a “moment in time.” Many of us are feeling the effects of quarantine, so the Viper “Stay Safe” spray is a nod to something we are all surviving together.

wash.png
Maps are probably our best source of Battlepass inspiration. Even we have a blast running and searching got map easter eggs created by the Maps team! The Chilly McFreeze snowman, Gelato Cutie, Immortal Rose, and all the Tacti-animal gun buddies originated from the Maps themselves. Even the infamous Octopus is based on a mural from Ascent. 

The folks on the Premium Content team also love playing VALORANT together. That’s why we try to reference some of our funny anecdotal in-game experiences (like the “No Time” spray) or stuff we see in highlight clips online. 

The randomized “Pick my Strat” spray is for when we’re tired of straight rushing long B only to die to something-that-should-have-been-obvious-like-Raze-ult and wish fate would tell us how to play our next round. And the “Piece of Cake” spray is our polite alternative to call something “easy,” instead of spamming GGEZ in the chat. 

Internal design contests help us gather pitches when we are short on inspiration. You can thank members of the VALORANT team for items like the “Scuttle Trash” Gun Buddy, suggested by a person who wanted to celebrate how “trash” she and her partner are at VALORANT. “Potato Aim” is another example—you can guess what that represents.

tader.png	trash.png
SPRAY-TO-SPEECH
Sometimes a post-clutch spray says more than any celebratory chant could. Our sprays, titles, and Gun Buddies are also an opportunity to let players non-verbally express themselves in a creative and practical way that is often better than a mic or text chat. 

For every spray we create, we ask ourselves “what is a player saying when they use this?” and how do we make this feel like a VALORANT spray? Or we start with the expression first and ask “how do we express this with a spray?” Some examples of our favorite spray communications/pairings:

Tell the world “I suck at this game!” - Pair the “Sad Crab” spray with the Potato Aim or Scuttle Trash Buddy, your pick
Toss out a casual “That was easy!” - “Piece of Cake” spray (also, maybe a future idea: a GG button, or a GGEZ button spray)
One-tap the enemy with a Sheriff? - Drop that “Cheaters Never Prosper” spray because who needs hacks?
Say it with pride: “I’m a filthy camper.” - Pair the Bucky card with the “Pumped” title and spam the “Camper” or “Cheesy Shot” spray after you blast an unsuspecting enemy with the Polyfox Judge
Hi, I’m Kevin Lee, a software engineer on VALORANT’s Game Systems team. Our team is responsible for developing many of the core systems that support VALORANT’s gameplay, including movement, combat and input. In this post, I’ll be going through one of the systems that’s core to FPS gameplay: Hit Registration.

In a game like VALORANT, hit registration is arguably one of the most important systems given that the difference between a win or loss can come down to a single headshot. Our goal as developers is to ensure that when a player fires a shot, the outcome of the shot is clear, feels right, and is above all else, correct.

We’ll sometimes see posts or receive messages from players with clips where hit reg appears broken. We take all of these reports seriously, and go through each video frame-by-frame to validate that the system is working as expected.

That being said, we think hit registration in VALORANT is in a pretty good spot right now. Yes, there may still be edge case bugs out there and we will always take those seriously. We’re constantly looking to improve the quality and clarity of all of our systems.

CORRECTNESS VS CLARITY
In beta patch 0.50, we saw a spike of reports around issues with hit registration. After looking through player reports, videos and extended internal testing, we were able to identify a few edge case bugs with hit registration, but none of them severe enough to explain the amount of reports we received. Upon closer review, the majority of the clips had issues not with correctness, but with clarity. The shots were being properly processed, but the visual feedback of the shot was presenting a misleading outcome to the player. This highlights an important distinction between correctness and clarity.

While both are important in ensuring the “feel” of a shot...

Correctness refers to the outcome of a shot being wrong (i.e., bullets hit the head but registers as body or enemy players appearing differently on the client compared to the server)
Clarity refers to the presentation of a shot being hard to read (i.e. bullet hit the shoulder, but visual feedback made it look like the bullet hit the head)
Correctness bugs are much worse than clarity bugs
We hope this article will shed some light on the system so everyone can look back at their gameplay and understand what’s happening on their screen, with respect to their shots. I’ll go over how the system works at a high level, and explain what happens from the moment the fire button is pressed, to the headshot being displayed.

For a more detailed technical deep dive, check out this article about VALORANT’s netcode on the Riot Tech Blog.

I’ll also go into some common cases we see when it comes to reports of “broken hit reg” and try to explain what’s going on and what we’re doing to improve clarity in those scenarios.

FROM CLICK TO HEADSHOT
Before we dive into what happens when a shot is fired, it’s important to understand how the game simulates what’s happening. VALORANT’s gameplay is simulated twice: once on the server (the authority for how the simulation plays out) and once on your client (predicting server results to make the game feel more responsive).

The game simulation includes everything that makes up the world including all player’s positions, any abilities flying through the air, and any smokes on the battlefield. Each frame, the game takes a snapshot of the simulation and uses that to render a frame on your screen. The server also does this for each of its frames (skipping the render step since there’s no one watching the server).

Ok so, an enemy peeks out from a corner, and with your amazing crosshair placement you’re already locked onto their head, so you hit the left mouse button to fire— What happens?

hit_reg_flow.jpg
The moment you press a key, the input is sent to our input system (subject to a small amount of hardware/operating system latency). Each game frame, the input system will process all the inputs it has received since the previous frame. When you fire a shot, that “fire” input is sent to the server alongside a timestamp for what frame in the simulation the shot happened.

It’s important to note that this timestamp is according to what is currently rendered on your screen at the time of the input being received by VALORANT. We now have to follow the shot on two different simulations: the client’s and the server’s.

Let’s start with the client, or your local machine. Immediately after the shot has been sent off to the server, the client starts working on displaying a muzzle flash and tracer for the shot. At the earliest, this will happen one frame after your input has been fired since the game needs to render a new frame to your screen. This is important because it means the frame a shot is processed is NOT the same frame that a tracer is displayed, it's actually at least one frame before.

This can sometimes lead to a failure in shot clarity. The common way this desync could be solved is to delay the bullet. We don’t do this because delaying the bullet adds input latency which we want to minimize in VALORANT. With respect to hit confirms, the client waits until it hears back from the server on the result before displaying a hit-confirm. In order to guarantee consistency across all users and to prevent cheaters from hacking their clients to give false shot results, shot results are entirely server authoritative.

Meanwhile, the server eventually receives a message from the client that a shot has been fired. Due to internet latency, time has passed since this shot has been fired. To ensure the shot is fired against the same simulation that was shown to the player, the server rewinds the simulation to the timestamp given by the client before evaluating hit registration. This includes rewinding player positions and animation poses. It then sends the result of the shot back to the client. For the sake of this example, let’s say it was a headshot!

The client will receive a message from the server with the result of the shot and then plays the VFX and audio that’s appropriate. In this case, it would be headshot VFX and audio. Because the client has to wait for the server to tell it the result of the shot there is a delay between the tracer and the hit effects equal to your connection’s round trip time (i.e. 40 ms to the server = 80 ms delay between tracer and hit VFX), plus a minor amount of processing time. With higher latencies, this delay can become noticeable in real-time.

This is something we’re actively working on improving from a clarity perspective.

CASE STUDY 1: HITTING MOVING TARGETS
Case_Study_1.gif

In a lot of reports regarding hit registration, we see that the target of the shot is running. Let’s take a closer look at what visually happens when a shot successfully hits a running target. We see the player gets a successful headshot on the running player. To more easily illustrate this issue in this example, the client is running at 60 FPS. You can see that in the frame before the tracer is fired, their crosshair aligns with the enemy’s head.

case-study-1_frame-1.jpg	case-study-1_frame-2.jpg
However, the frame where the tracer comes out, that is no longer the case.

case_study_1_part_2.gif
The second clip shows the same scenario, but with the shot barely missing the target. When you look at the video frame by frame, you can see that the opposite is true: their crosshair is off the head on the frame before the tracer, but on the head the frame the tracer comes out. On first glance, you might think to point to the frame with the tracer and say “See, this was clearly a headshot!” When reviewing video or replays, we actually need to be looking at the frame before the tracer to get an accurate picture of when the shot was fired.

case-study-1_part2_frame-1.jpg	case-study-1_part2_frame-2.jpg
case-study-1_part2_no-hit-vfx.jpg	
Let’s go back to the example where the shot hit and look at the frame when the hit VFX is rendered. There is a noticeable gap between the player’s current location and the location of the hit VFX due to the delay caused by internet latency. This can be confusing when you’re trying to understand what happened with your shot, since you’ll most likely be focused on the enemy's current location, not their location at the time of the shot. This can also lead to additional confusion in crouching/strafing scenarios (which we will look at in Case Study 2).

case-study-1_part2_frame-where-hit-vfx-rendered.jpg
This case study illustrates a lack of clarity with the current hit registration system. Ideally, you don’t need to understand all this background information to be able to read the situation clearly. As developers, we acknowledge this and are investigating ways to improve clarity in these cases.

CASE STUDY 2: CROUCHING INTO SHOT VFX
So you’ve entered a gun fight at long range. To your future self’s regret, you hold down left click and spray your gun. At least one of those bullets will be a headshot, right? But no, you hit 3 body shots with your Vandal, dealing 117 damage, before receiving a headshot in return.

Furious, you go to review the footage after the game, certain that bad hit reg was at play. You see the enemy player was spamming crouch in an attempt to dodge your shots. To your surprise, you see a hit VFX right on top of their head while the player is crouching. But your combat report only showed body shots! What gives??

Here’s a link to a real post on reddit titled “Headshots not registering when a player crouches” of the hypothetical.

When our team goes to investigate reports of bad hit reg, situations like this one are the most frequent cause for what appears to be incorrect hit registration. In fact, hit registration is working correctly—shots are going where you're aiming (ignoring spread or movement error) when you press the fire button, and that shot is accurately registering on the server

However, a few different factors cause this particular case to be visually misleading:

Hit VFX are delayed due to internet latency
Hit VFX are displayed at the location of the original shot impact
The target player is moving (most often crouching)
Case_Study_2.gif
For another example, let’s say the player has 50 ping. The player hits a shoulder shot on the enemy player. Because we need to wait for the server to confirm the hit, it’s 100 ms later when the hit VFX starts to play on the location of the body shot. But during that 100 ms, the enemy player has started to crouch, moving their head right behind the newly spawned hit VFX. At long range and in the heat of a gunfight, a body hit VFX can be confused for a headshot hit VFX.

case-study-2_cursor-on-body.jpg case-study-2_hit-VFX-on-body-correctly.jpg case-study-2_player-crouches-into-vfx.jpg
This was especially bad during beta patch 0.50 when blood was unintentionally disabled for everyone, and our spark VFX has less visual clarity in distinguishing headshots and body shot VFX. We’ve always had separate VFX to indicate body shots vs headshots, but we realize they didn’t always read clearly in combat.

This is a failure in hit registration clarity that we are actively trying to improve. One of the things we’re experimenting with is tying hit VFX to the body part of the character where the hit occurred, so that there is a clear relationship—even with high latency.

Comparison of our current non-blood headshot hit VFX compared to body shot VFX:

headshot-VFX.jpg	body-shot-VFX.jpg
PLANNED CLARITY IMPROVEMENTS
The two case studies highlight some areas where our current hit confirm VFX falls short. One of the changes we’re iterating on is to have blood and spark effects spawn on the character’s current position, according to which part of their body got hit, and follow them as they move. This greatly increases the clarity in situations like in case study 2 with crouching enemies, because the visual effect will move with their body movements.

One trade-off to this approach is that it would be possible for hit confirm VFX to move behind cover alongside its attached character. Consider the case of a player with 100 ms of ping shooting at a player jiggle peeking a corner. If they land a shot on the enemy and they immediately move back behind a corner before the hit confirm arrives from the server, the shooter may not be able to see the hit confirm when it spawns.

We’ve considered adding multiple particles, some that follow the character and others that spawn immediately at the hit location, based on the client simulation, to mitigate this issue. However, this in turn can cause confusion if the client and server simulations ever disagree on the outcome of a shot: The effects need to be clear in what they represent so it’s easy to understand the outcome of a shot.

We’re continuing to iterate on this and other improvements to clarity and hope to have a set of clarity updates to share soon, in a future patch.

KEEP SENDING VIDEOS
Hopefully this post has helped you better understand how hit registration works in VALORANT and better understand why shots resolve the way they do. Please keep sending us videos any time you think hit reg is misbehaving, we do try our best to look at all of them.

Even if there’s no issue at hand, it helps us track down hit registration correctness bugs faster when they do happen (my heart rate also jumps each time I see the word “Hit Reg” on a top voted reddit post).
Hello, I’m Brandon Wang, a software engineer on VALORANT’s Content Support team, pairing up with Weapon Artist Chris Stone today for a look at the development of our recent Spline weapon skin, and generally, how engineers and artists collaborate to deliver memorable content for you all.

Spline was another challenge to do something different. Skins like Elderflame and Prime were really out there but we’ve yet to attempt a line for those who prefer a subtle weapon skin but still wanted unique geometry and some subtle VFX. With concept art in hand, the Content Support team tested the design with players—and lucky for us, they dug it. Maybe it was the strange and abstract shapes not typical for FPS designs. Take a look:

Spline_Concept_1920x1080_V1.jpg
Getting those orbs to come alive was a special challenge unto itself because the depth we were pursuing couldn’t be done through VFX alone. The fantasy that tested so well would fall flat if the orbs were only emissive. 

And thus, the beautiful partnership between Content Support and Premium Content teams came in for the save. With help on the engineering end, our artists experimented with our awesome in-game shader to not only create the Spline orb shader but other shaders that you all see in VALORANT today.

ART, MEET ENGINEERING
Early in VALORANT’s life, I (Brandon) was working on a lot of foundational and fundamental work to optimize shaders (the programs behind what most people consider a game’s graphics) and help drive the art style. 

Once we solidified our art style and the game was performing close to where we liked on the GPU side, I jumped to help out other teams with very specific needs in my specialty: engineering in rendering and materials.

unnamed.gif
One of the materials I helped develop was the Sage Orb. We wanted to have a gem-like power-source for Sage, so I built a prototype using parallax to make it look like there’s a flowing, floating, cloudy core inside.

orb_concept.gif	orb_final.gif
(Left: My original prototype, right: production version)

VFX artists took the prototype and the workings behind it, tuned the look and topped it with their own take to hit the final version you see in-game. 

For weapon skins in particular, I added a touch of interesting tech. Prism, Avalanche, and Nebula were all originally experiments and prototypes on the base weapon models to see if unique effects, in a similar vein to Sage’s orbs, would make exciting skins.

But it’s not enough to make an interesting effect—we need to build one that’s “tunable” in an artist-friendly way. For Prism, we used gradients to tune the effect and colors.


Avalanche began as a hodgepodge of different effects combined to try and make a pink Himalayan salt lamp (as inspired by the lamp on the desk of VALORANT’s PR manager). That didn’t look quite right. Then our artists saw the blue version and drove the skin to the direction you see today.

unnamed_(1).png
unnamed_(2).png
[Original Avalanche prototypes]



Avalanche_Asset.jpg
Nebula started off as a simple “portal to another world,” but we needed a decent amount of engineering effort to reduce the texture to fit into our performance budgets, even for players running on low spec machines (these limits make it so the game will run as fast as possible, even when using fancy skins).

We ended up using a single face of a cubemap, tiled horizontally to be seamless, and added a “detail” texture on top. Unfortunately, this version caused some players motion sickness, and we didn’t want to ruin any keyboards. So, our artists drove the fantasy further and reduced the effect to prevent nausea. And then we ran some extra playtests with VALORANT devs who said they’re prone to motion sickness IRL and in games.

early_nebula.jpg

These engineering prototypes are nowhere close to production-ready skins. All of these prototypes end up as tools for artists to select from in their own work. Whereas Prism, Avalanche, and Nebula directly became the main portions of their respective skin lines, Spline marries the tech behind Sage’s orbs to support the rest of the skin. Speaking of Sage’s Orbs, I reme— Wait, don’t take my keyboard away, I built that, it’s my ke—

—ENGINEERING, MEET ART
HEY, it’s Chris jumping in now. Oh, this is a sweet keyboard. That actuation force...

So the original Sage shader as mentioned above was fantastic, no doubt. But it missed the fantasy of the Spline Orb that we had in our original concept. I hit up Bwang (that’s Brandon) and asked him to break down the Sage shader a tad. After he explained how the shader network was set up in our game engine, I was able to make some slight adjustments on my end to better support our artistic goals for Weapon Skins. 

After I made the adjustments, I hopped into Substance Designer, a node-based texturing software, to work on some new textures that would better fit with the style of the conceptual orb while also working within our performance and shader constraints (the ones about making the game run as fast as possible).

Below is a snippet taken from the process of creating new textures. By the end of the process, we were able to create something more abstract from the Sage orb to match the fantasy of the Spline concept.

cstone_spline_sagecompare_02.gif
As a bonus, let's quickly look at another collaboration with the Content Support team: the custom shader used on the Prism skin line. After a few Bwang lessons, we were able to go in and add some custom controls that could modulate the orb’s Iridescence effect.

Take a look:

Prism_Asset.jpg
MORE COLLABS ON THE WAY
These are just a few examples of Premium Content and Content Support working closely together to develop new shaders for VALORANT that lead to distinct skins for everyone.

Spline_Collection.jpg
We do carry other day-to-day responsibilities that make it so not every skin line can go through this process, but it’s always exciting when we’re able to prototype new shaders for you all. Hopefully this shows the power that comes from cross-team collaboration, when both teams are invested in making something cool. 

It’s easy for us to have a common goal when we try to think of what would excite you. We always have artists and engineers working closely together, and we’re learning new workflows as we go!
As we near the end of VALORANT Act I, we want to lay out our plans for the Competitive experience at the end of an Act, and discuss new features starting in Act II.

Currently in our Competitive system, your rank is very closely tied to your skill (MMR) and it can move up or down fluidly depending on if you are having a good or bad day of competitive play. We want you to have an accurate representation of your current skill in matches. We also want to build a ranked system that promotes growth and engagement over ‘peaking’ at a top rank, getting anxious about losing it, and stuffing it in the fridge.

Let’s talk about our next steps!

COMPETITIVE ACT II UPDATE & ACT RANKS
The takeaway: After an Act, all that matters for your Act Rank are your 9 best ranked wins of the act, and how many wins you’ve gotten in the act. So if you peak at Diamond but drop down to Gold, your act rank will only remember the good times. Take another run at Immortal, push those lower rank games out!

Let’s break down the details:

Your rank will still be a close reflection of your current rating
We are now introducing “Act Ranks,” which track your ‘proven skill’ (this is new!), highest ranked win, and # of competitive wins in the Act
At the end of the act, your Act Rank will be preserved as a badge on your player card in Competitive Games (and in your career history)
Your ‘proven skill’ is your 9th best ranked win of the Act, to demonstrate you can consistently win at that level
Your highest ranked win is self-explanatory: It’s the highest ranked win you’ve achieved in the act (right at the top of that triangle)
Your Act Rank border is the surrounding border that evolves based on your number of competitive wins in the Act
You’ll also be able to review past Act Rank info in your Career Tab
ACT RANK
act_2_ranked_article_1_v2.jpg
As you play, your Act Rank fills with smaller triangles. Each triangle represents your ranked match wins (Gold, Immortal, etc.) over the course of an Act based on the rank you entered the game with (hence your rank for that match).

Wins at higher ranks visually replace your lowest wins to display the best of your Competitive games. For example, more wins at Radiant will push out your earliest wins at Bronze (very aspirational!).

The border also changes as you hit these win thresholds: 9, 25, 50, 75, and 100.

Starting in Act II, your friends will be able to inspect your Match History, including both your rank and overall Act Rank progress.

ACT RANK BADGE
act_2_ranked_article_2_v2.jpg
You can view your progress toward your Act Rank Badge anytime in the career page.

Your Act Rank Badge shows off your proven skill (best ranked match wins) for that Act. This is based on your top nine ranked wins. Remember, you will have to prove your skill at that rank if you want to finalize it as your Act Rank.

For Act I, we’ve decided to not award an Act Rank Badge because we figure you want to know what you’re getting into before commemorating it with a badge. Again, for Act II, you’ll be able to earn that Act Rank Badge, which memorializes your Act II competitive skill and will display on your player card during Act III Competitive games.

While we always plan to allow you to view your prior Act Rank progress in your Career Tab, your Act Rank Badge will represent your latest Act Rank and proven skill, so other players have a good indication of how you’ve been playing in the past two months.

COMPETITIVE & END OF ACTS
act_2_ranked_article_3.jpg
With each VALORANT Act, we plan to deliver a host of fresh content as well as balance changes. As the game evolves, we want to give both new and returning players an opportunity to jump back in and see how their skills stack up in the new Act.

Here’s what happens at the end of an Act for Competitive:

Your prior Act Rank will be saved and locked in your Career tab
Act 1 Competitive data will be saved
You will be put back into abridged placements.
It will take 3 games to display your rank instead of the initial 5
These placements are quicker as we will reference your MMR from the prior Act, so we can quickly assess your skill for the current Act.
Your rank will be a conservative placement where we are confident you are able to compete at that skill level—or higher.
Typically, your Rank will land a couple of tiers below where you ended the prior Act, but we’ll be increasing how heavily we weigh performance in your early games so you can quickly improve your rank if you play well and win
Placement games don’t count toward earning your Act Rank.
WHAT’S AHEAD
We look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on Competitive and Act Ranks.

As we get closer to the end of Act II, we’ll share another update on our next steps for evolving the Competitive experience. Right now a couple of the top priority areas we are looking at is improving transparency and clarity into your rank changes, along with solving some pain points for high rank players. We also always welcome hearing from you all other features and improvements you want to see.
Hey VALORANT competitors, ahead of our global launch of Competitive Matchmaking during patch 1.02, we wanted to give you an update on what to expect when you queue up.

A huge thank you to all of you for the feedback during VALORANT Closed Beta, your input helped inform our next steps. So, based on that feedback, we targeted a few areas to level up for Competitive launch.

On that note, it’s worth saying that this ranked system is a living work in progress, so don’t stop your comments. Expect us to continue to make improvements based on your feedback.

Changes for launch:

Updated rank iconography and top rank name
Easier to play with your friends
Soon after patch 1.02:

Rank Progression
RANK ICONOGRAPHY
VALORANT_ICONS_2.jpg
We knew going into Closed Beta we wanted to take another pass at rank iconography and taking your feedback into account we’ve made the following changes:

Clarity pass for rank colors so it's easier to distinguish between each rank
Visual polish pass for each Match Rating
Additionally, although we still really like having our top rank be something unique to our game and aligned with our IP, we’ve decided to remove VALORANT as the name of our top rank to help reduce potential confusion of the game vs the rank. 

The new name for our top rank will represent Agents infused with powers, known as Radiant.

PLACEMENT MATCHES & PREMADES
We really believe in VALORANT teamplay, playing and competing with your friends. So we’ve made it easier to play with teammates in placements, and will continue to work to further optimize for balanced matches, regardless of your premade size. This is an ongoing commitment from us.

You can now matchmake with your friends during placements even if they have a fairly large skill discrepancy—to a certain extent. For example, if you’re an elite player, and your friend is still learning the ropes, our Competitive Matchmaking will still prevent you from being able to queue in order to protect the competitive integrity and experience for the other players in that match.

We also are continuing to optimize our matchmaking to ensure that, regardless of your premade size, you are put into fair and balanced matches. By the end of closed beta, we were narrowing in on matches being about 50/50 fairness for the vast majority of skill groups (outside of our most elite players in our top two ranks).

For Immortal and Radiant players, we’ve made some improvements to our matchmaking, but we know that for this specific tier of play, there is still a slight advantage to being in a 5-stack vs playing solo in these top ranks. We are looking into tactics to help address this problem, and plan to share more later this year.

RANK PROGRESSION
In every VALORANT Act—which spans about two months—you’ll have the opportunity to track your rank progress throughout the Act. We will start tracking your rank progress as soon as we launch Competitive with patch 1.02 behind the scenes, and soon after we will be providing you visible info in your Match History, and eventually in other locations in the client, around your overall performance for the Act. Rank progress we are looking at tracking are stats such as how you’ve climbed in rank over the Act, your number of wins, along with your wins at your highest achieved rank.

THE BEYOND
We’ve seen a ton of demand for competitive-related features that support teams, in-client tournaments, fairer overtime handling, and more granular top rank comparisons - such as leaderboards. For now, we are primarily focused on getting Competitive Matchmaking globally launched. However, we do want to eventually address these needs.

Our vision for the future highlights teamplay as a critical part of the VALORANT Competitive Ecosystem. We want to create the opportunity for all players to come together and compete at high stakes as a team, with the hope these team-oriented competitive matches will be memorable and rewarding events.

Expect to hear more on this topic later in 2020.
Hey it’s Paul “Arkem” Chamberlain, your VALORANT anti-cheat lead here again with a quick spotlight on the importance of player reports.

One of the most powerful tools in the fight against cheaters is player reports. Reporting gives players a way to directly tell us, your faithful anti-cheat team, what suspicious activity is going on in their games. Unlike Vanguard’s automated systems (Riot Vanguard is our anti-cheat system) reports bring human insight to our anti-cheat efforts at an otherwise unobtainable scale and bring with it a direct look at everyone’s experience in game. It’s really important that players use the in-game reporting tools everytime they see something suspicious, it’s the best way to help us keep the game fair!

I promise some spicy numbers at the end.

REPORTS LIFE CYCLE
Reports feed into many of our team’s processes both automated and manual. On the automated side, the Vanguard backend uses reports to decide whether or not a player should receive additional scrutiny, such as a higher intensity game integrity scan. Vanguard also uses the number of reports (more specifically the number of unique reporters and number of games in which the player was reported) as an indication of confidence in its findings—which helps us ban players faster and, in many cases, without manual review.

Our anti-cheat analysts also use reports to drive the manual review process. Each day the analysts (sometimes guest starring myself) review the most suspicious players, usually starting with the most reported players. These manual reviews help us find cheats that aren’t automatically detected that we then use to improve Vanguard so that automatic detection (and bans) will happen in the future. We also use these manual reviews as an opportunity to remove the most disruptive players ahead of schedule. We often use “ban-waves” to keep cheat developers guessing as to whether or not their cheat is currently detected but we’re happy to early-exit the most disruptive cheaters to better protect the game.

Finally, we use reports as a measure of the health of the game as well as the effectiveness of Vanguard. If the overall number of reports is going up then that’s a sign to us as developers that players are feeling bad about the integrity of the game (regardless of the accuracy of each individual report). Likewise one way we can assess the effectiveness of Vanguard is by comparing the percentage of players reported for cheating versus the percentage of players detected by Vanguard.

BY THE NUMBERS
I know everyone likes stats, so I asked our anti-cheat data science friends to find some juicy numbers for you all to see.

First of all, 97% of players have never even received a single report—no one has ever found their behavior suspicious enough to comment on. Of these 3% of players that have been reported for cheating, more than 80% of them have only ever been reported by a single player. 90% have been reported by fewer than 3 players.

To put this another way, only 0.6% of players have received more than 1 cheating report and only 0.3% have received 3 or more. However, reports and cheaters aren’t perfectly correlated, many reported players are innocent and not all cheaters get reported before they’re banned. Right now only 53% of banned cheaters were reported before their ban and only 60% of players with 20 reports get banned after review.

But even without a perfect correlation, reports are extremely helpful.

So why am I telling you this? I want you all to report more, whenever you see something suspicious in your game please use the report system so we can see it too. Your reports are invaluable to us, your view from the ground is the best intelligence we could ask for and when we work together great things are possible!
Hi everyone, Paul “Arkem” Chamberlain, VALORANT’s not-at-all-scary anti-cheat lead, here to talk to you about anti-cheat (surprise). I’ve popped up a few times already to talk about specific anti-cheat systems and give quick updates or high level overviews on cheating topics—but I wanted to take some time today to go over our anti-cheat strategy from top to bottom.

Consider this the What, Why, and How of VALORANT anti-cheat.

Firstly the “Why,” as in, why am I talking about this so much and why are we collectively spending all this effort fighting cheating? Frankly, it’s because I believe that it’s what players (that’s all of you) expect and demand from their tactical shooters. Along with our other commitments to competitive integrity, anti-cheat is a core requirement, the “table stakes” for a serious competitive experience.

Next the “What.” What exactly are we trying to accomplish for anti-cheat in VALORANT? The goal is to build a trustworthy gaming experience by making cheating as rare as possible. This means that we aim to prevent as many cheats as possible and detect anything that we can’t prevent. We know that we can’t stop all cheaters immediately but we believe we can deal with them to the point that most players rarely, if ever, encounter a cheater.

So, “How” can we achieve this? How do we think we can protect the game experience from cheats? It’s fundamentally a defense in depth approach. We first build the game to be as cheat-resistant as we can (e.g., Fog of War, and server authoritative movement netcode). Next, we make the cost of developing cheats as prohibitive as possible (e.g., Vanguard and other anti-tamper measures). Finally we detect, ban, and remove cheaters from the game as efficiently as possible using Vanguard cheat detection, hardware bans, player reports, data analysis, and machine learning research.

Yes, cheats are still possible in VALORANT—there are already some examples out in the wild. But this strategy makes those cheats much more difficult to develop and maintain. This in turn makes them more expensive to buy, which limits how many cheaters there are in the game. The smaller community of capable cheat developers also makes their cheats easier to keep track of and enables us to take other approaches—such as legal avenues—to keeping them out of our ecosystem.

fogofwar_off.jpg	fogofwar_on.jpg
This leads us to the real big questions: How do we know if we’re winning and what does success look like?

There are a lot of ways to measure success. Often we hear reports of “X number of players banned” and game studios using internal metrics like “percentage of players cheating” or “percentage of games impacted by cheating.” While those numbers are useful indicators, they’re of secondary importance to VALORANT.

Our anti-cheat for VALORANT is designed to make sure players can trust the game and have a positive experience while playing. So our primary success criteria is how well you all think we’re doing. We track the number of player reports for cheating, we ask players directly via surveys for their impression, and we keep track of player sentiment on social media (hi twitter!).

In short, if you’re not happy with us... then we aren’t successful. Anti-cheat is here to serve players, so please let us know how we’re doing.

We’ve talked about how we design Agents in the past—and we talk about making League champions a lot. This time we want to share more about how we made Neon because it’s a bit different from how we usually do things. But first, a quick refresher.

We design Agents through a process called DNA. A game designer, narrative writer, and concept artist are assigned to an upcoming Agent, and in the beginning, there’s just a starting seed—like a design, narrative, or diversity goal. This could be making another Radiant, or adding another duelist to the roster, or exploring a different region of the world with a character who calls it home.

From there, the core team (because there are a lot more folks involved than just DNA) brainstorms... a lot. They toss around ideas, create paper prototypes, write flash bios, and draw spreads of concept art.

Slowly we have someone who feels unique, cohesive, and adds something exciting to the current roster. Then bam, you have 500 files named finalfinalFINALIPROMISE, hundreds of animations, meshes breaking in places no one knew possible, sound effects playing randomly, wait why is their face texture on their hands... Oh look, we have an Agent!

They release, armchair designers come out of the woodwork on Reddit, Twitter explodes with an overabundant amount of fan art, and everyone turns on all chat to flame Rioters in-game.

Except, that’s not Neon’s story.

Listen, we go on the internet. We’ve seen your fan theories and side-by-side comparisons of Neon and Zeri, League’s newest champ. And to officially set the record straight: No, they’re not the same characters, no they’re not related, but they were made in tandem by the League and VALORANT teams.

“How did it get started?” You ask. As many things do, the Agents Team Lead John “Riot MEMEMEMEME” Goscicki and League Champions Team Lead Ryan “Reav3” Mireles were scheming.

011422_NeonChampionInsights_Sprint.jpg

MIGHT MESS AROUND AND MAKE CHARACTERS TOGETHER
“A long time ago we were brainstorming what we could do for the launch of Arcane (League’s new animated show on Netflix—go watch it). It was a huge moment for all of us at Riot, so I messaged Goscicki to ask if he wanted to co-launch a champion and Agent together during the event,” recalls Mireles.

“It made a lot of sense, a lot of the VALORANT Agents team worked on the Champions team before—Goscicki included—and we share a lot of the same processes. And a lot of Riot players play both League and VALORANT. So we thought it’d be cool if they could play these two characters in both games,” Mireles shares.

“I actually remember that even before that conversation, you and I would message each other and say, ‘One day we’ll co-launch characters. One day we’ll collaborate and it’ll be cool,’” laughs Goscicki. “And then when this opportunity came up we were like, ‘IS TODAY THE DAY???’ And yes, it finally was the day.”

But before they got started, the team needed to figure out what they were actually making.

League and VALORANT are very different games in very different IPs. Sure, they’re both online competitive games developed by a small indie company with a penchant for nerfing your main. But League’s set in a fantasy world where champions actually use abilities to get kills, whereas in VALORANT, shooting matters and you don’t kill with abilities (allegedly). They just create tactical opportunities to take the right shot.

That meant Mireles and Goscicki needed to do a bit of groundwork before development really began.

“When either of our teams get started, we generally have a pretty good understanding of our goals. But when it came to Zeri and Neon we just... didn’t really know what that space looked like,” admits Mireles.

“In League we have diversity goals in terms of role, region, gender, and playstyle. VALORANT has most of these as well—but they’re very different from what we do in League. So we needed to make sure we found a space that was good for both of our games, and was exciting for players. Because if no one wanted to play these characters, what was the point?” Mireles asks.

That meant the characters needed to stand on their own. Sure, a bunch of us play both games, but the majority choose one and stick with it. And while adding a mute K-pop heartthrob who assassinates people with magical moon weapons gifted from his twin sister who lives in space to VALORANT just because Aphelios exists in League might be a fun idea, that doesn’t mean it works.

Old friends and good intentions aside... how the actual f*&^ do you design a champ and an Agent together? The answer is surprisingly simple: Combine teams.

LIGHTNING CAN STRIKE TWICE
“I’m a huge fan of VALORANT. When it first released, I talked to a few of the game designers on the team like, ‘You know, I’d love to make an Agent some time...’ And so when we were told about this opportunity I just jumped at it,” Game Designer August “August” Browning laughs. “Making two characters in tandem meant we faced a bunch of new constraints, which is fun and exciting as a designer. We needed to find a shared power source—but something that works in both League and VALORANT. We needed to figure out if their personalities were similar or opposite and complementary... There were so many questions that needed to be answered.”

Let’s start with the power source.

League’s a world of endless possibilities when it comes to sources of power for its champions. There’s a space dragon who created the cosmos, a doll with magic scissors, and a literal mountain (whose ultimate is to move really fast—don’t ask). VALORANT has two: Tech and Radiants.

Raze throws grenades, Killjoy uses bots, and Cypher is Great Value Inspector Gadget. Phoenix throws solar fire, Jett uses wind, and Sage resurrects her allies in front of a cracked enemy with an Op. So the team decided to brainstorm some ideas for a shared power source across both games.

011422_NeonChampionInsights_Run.png

During brainstorms, Concept Artists Konstantin “Zoonoid” Maystrenko, Nancy “Riot Sojyoo” Kim, and Gem “Lonewingy” Lim talked about the common denominators between League and VALORANT. The first being speed.

VALORANT rewards you for good rotations, ego peeking, silent flanking, and flash banging your entire team as they push the point. Whereas League’s about running it down mid setting up flank TPs to enable your fed top laner to push a side lane while you goon squad mid. And while there are plenty of Agents who are really mobile (nerf Jett), there’s no one who literally embodies speed.

“Neon’s constant access to speed means she’s the most mobile Agent in VALORANT,” Game Designer Ryan “rycou” Cousart explains. “She completely shatters what we know about speed and mobility in the game and will heavily test players’ moment-to-moment decision making as a duelist. With great risk comes electrifying rewards.” :) LOL (Addition insisted upon by Cousart.)

But “move fast” isn’t a power source. Sure, running laps on the enemy team is fun, but other than “run really fast” what can they do? So the team took a step back to find a source of power, something that explains why Neon and Zeri would go fast.

“We landed on the idea of electricity, which lent itself to the speed idea,” shares Lim. “But it also had this nice tie-in to where we wanted these characters to be from in the real-world: the Philippines. I grew up in Manila, and we were planning on making Filipina characters—something that means a lot to me, personally. And in Manila we have a lot of blackouts, and electricity problems in general. It just felt like a nice little nod to life there.”

011422_NeonChampionInsights_Portraits.png

Neon’s negative charge bandage and Zeri’s positive charge bandage were added to further illustrate their “opposite charges” narrative theme

Lightning also fit who these characters became.

“We latched onto this narrative concept of positive and negative when we saw the electricity concept art. Both Neon and Zeri have this feeling of fighting for their communities, but we still wanted them to be their own people,” explains Narrative Writer Michael “SkiptoMyLuo” Luo.

“Neon’s the negative charge and Zeri’s the positive. Neon’s prickly and a bit more guarded—blunt, sarcastic, slightly biting. It seems like she doesn’t care about you, but deep down she does care and wants to do the right thing. Compared to Zeri’s warm, bright—but still stubborn and impatient at times—personality, we just felt like it was a cool way to tie their electricity theme into who they are,” Luo adds.

011422_NeonChampionInsights_Expression.png

Both Neon and Zeri come from big, supportive families and communities—something inspired by the “Bayanihan Spirit” in Filipino culture—but what makes them different is their reaction to it.

“Neon comes from a big family in the heart of Manilla,” explains Narrative Writer Joe “Riot ParmCheesy” Killeen. “Unlike Zeri, who embraces the love and support from her family, Neon is overwhelmed by it. She still loves them, and has a strong sense of service and duty for her community, but she’s more withdrawn. It’s just a different reaction to a similar upbringing, which we thought was a cool opportunity to explore while making these characters.”

“WHY NOT?”
But combining forces to make characters together still had its challenges. And while we’re one company, we’re still talking about two wholly different games.

“August had some really... interesting ideas for gameplay early on in development,” laughs Cousart. “We knew we wanted to go with speed, and he pitched the idea that Neon had full access to a sprint at all times. With no cooldown.

Speed’s one of the ways we can create consistent learnability in VALORANT. Pros and high-level players can tell you the exact amount of time it takes to go from site-to-site, so the idea that we should just shatter that honestly gave us night terrors,” he continues.

011422_NeonChampionInsights_KeyArt.png

“The reason I gave Neon finger guns is because August wanted Zeri to be reliant on a VALORANT-style gun, so I wanted to try making Neon not have a gun,” says Cousart

Another early game design idea for Neon was a one-shot LIGHTNING HANDS mechanic that was completely accurate while running and reset (don’t ever complain about something being OP again, thanks). And while this was certainly a unique take on an Agent, it was too much. So the team pulled back and put some design constraints into place: No one-shots, sure. Cooldown on sprint? Ehhh... About that.

Neon’s fantasy is to run fast and zap people while doing it. And restricting her access to speed left her feeling pretty sluggish. That meant August and Cousart needed to ask themselves a hard question: Is it worth challenging what we know about movement in VALORANT?

“We decided to go with giving Neon constant access to speed, at all times, with no cooldowns,” August shares. “Instead of going with the cooldown we restricted the strength of it in other ways. Like making it so her guns are down and she can’t jiggle peek at high speeds. This means you’re at risk whenever you want to use her speed, a stronger knife run in many ways. We just felt like, overall, this made more sense for her power fantasy, which is to run fast for extended periods of time.”


“Something August really helped with was challenging the way we think about designing Agents overall, not just Neon,” Cousart shares. “Every time he encountered a guardrail we’d had in place for VALORANT design he just asked us ‘Why not? Why can’t we do this thing?’ It taught us a lot of things: Why VALORANT is different from League, sure. But it also helped us realize where the similarities are.

Cousart continues, “I’m not saying that every guardrail should be smashed, but it taught us to test what we thought was our limit previously, instead of pushing to try new things. It made us learn more about our own game, and changed the way we think about design on Agents in the future.”

But don’t worry. If you’re really concerned about what this means for our next Agents, rest assured that the next one’s definitely not a duelist
Hi, I’m Suke, Principal Illustrator on VALORANT. We’d thought it would be fun to show you a little of what goes into the VALORANT illustration process, our style, and how we tell the story of Astra through art.

But first, watch this!


As part of Episode 2 Act 2, we just added Astra, our newest VALORANT Agent. Like gameplay, it’s not enough just to have something new. Each Agent illustration should really stand on its own while maintaining a style and coherence with the rest of the VALORANT world.

Every Agent illustration starts with a “thumbnail” as shown above.

Thumbnails are quick and simple. We use them so we can explore multiple options without committing, making the whole process time effective, since we can’t go back once we move on to the next steps.

During this process, we keep in mind who the character is, what their attitude and personality are like, if they have distinct features, e.g. a gauntlet. We strive to emphasize what is most important for the character so you can understand them at a glance.

One thing that is always important is focusing on keeping the shapes really cool and exciting. It’s more about that, and less about rendering them realistically—and it’s a pretty tough balance to manage!

VALORANT “KEY ART”
3_9_21_AstraA15KeyArtBTSArticle_embed.jpg

When it comes to what we consider our VALORANT “key art” (the image you see everywhere to promote new stuff), the process begins with thinking from your perspective: what feeling do we want to give you and what do you want to experience?

For Astra, we wanted to show her Controller role in some way. From a character perspective, she is an Agent defined by her source of power. She also has a youthful intensity and playful personality.

So, how do we visually represent these vibes through composition and pose? It starts with a couple of rough sketches, where we pick the direction she’s floating in the air, and give a subtle understanding of her role. This way, the viewer (you) understands that her power is related to the sky.

In the second round, we picked a version of the sketch where her body is slightly tilted. We wanted to give you an idea of how she gains control while also showing hints of that playful personality. As you can see in the video above, it got pushed even further in the next phase, when I angle her face toward the “camera” with a very subtle smirk.

A very fun part of her design is mixing her aura of power with an African Futurism element. I really enjoyed playing with the golden arm effects, especially when the lower arm pieces start to float and her “true” form is revealed.

3_9_21_AstraA15KeyArtBTSArticle_Astra_Wallpapers_purple.jpg

She also has a really powerful ultimate in-game that we are definitely excited about. Even though we couldn’t show all of her abilities in one piece, we can still display her power casting in a really vibrant way.

After all, when everything comes together, she comes alive. The progress from thumbnail to finish even caught me by surprise! Hope you guys like it too!
It’s been a minute since the last time I typed words into a Google Doc–but here we are. Patch 4.04 brought the great wave of Controller balance changes, Yoru’s Rework created the craziest of fakeouts, and we had some … unfortunate bugs here and there. We are still monitoring how the landscape of VALORANT is settling after these changes, so I don’t want to comment prematurely, but there are definitely some fun new plays happening.

I wanted to give a quick note around future balance updates/ongoing conversations. Whether it be a future State of the Agents, Dev Diaries, or any other location, you will see the rest of the design and balance team speaking towards those topics in various channels.

Most of my updates will be focused on New Agents… so with that said, let's get into the next Agent!

Remember, new Agents take 12–15 months to develop, and we focus on questions like:

What is missing from current, core playstyles?
Are there thematics that present big opportunities?
What’s needed for game health?
…and more.
You can also get a better idea about our development priorities (and see us talk) in the latest Neon Dev Diary.

There have been a lot of conversations within the Characters team around Initiators, specifically Sova. His Initiation tools are unique in that they rely on reconnaissance and information gathering to give you and the team tools to decide your next step. So much of VALORANT’s tactical loop revolves around information. Knowing where enemies are/are not and exploiting that info to execute during that sliver of a window is key to many successful wins.

So the notion of another Agent that revolves around the information gathering aspect of the tactical loop has, for a while, been top of mind for us.

Within that space we had a dream for something new, so when “NickWu”joined the team (previously part of Premium Content) we put his expert eyes on this opportunity. Our focus early on was identifying unique gameplay differences within the realm of recon/info, and landed in a space that has more “localized” Initiation and recon tools.

This next Agent should give you a more…intimate feeling when hunting down enemies. Of course, there is our theme—but the thought of giving away too much frightens me so I’ll leave that out.

Well friends, I’ve searched my thoughts for all the words to type here, and that's all I got. I keep having this recurring nightmare that I won’t finish the Act II Battlepass (THE BP IS SO GOOD I NEED TIER 48). I’m scared of the grind, but hey “Herkesin bir korkusu var.”
Welcome back into 2022. This is the Characters Team’s Part 2 of the Yoru Update article from last year. Right upfront, we are aiming to launch the Yoru rework during Episode 4 Act II.

Before we get there, we want to show which way the design direction is headed, our concept explorations to pair with the gameplay changes, and work-in-progress art in-game. Our time as of writing this is focused on bringing these changes to life—these always take quite a bit of time!

The loop of creating art to match gameplay, playtest, and iterate based on feedback always takes a bit of time, but ultimately, it’s what leads to VALORANT’s consistent, tactical gameplay.

Let’s kick this off with a chunky change.

Ep1_a1_article_Divider_yoru.jpg

FAKEOUT

Fakeout—an ability that currently directionally mimics the sound of Yoru’s footsteps to mislead enemies—is now a full copy of Yoru, that runs forward, and when damaged, explodes and debuffs enemies.

As added flavor, when the copy is shot, it faces the direction of the person that fired the shot and flashes towards their position in a conal direction. A change like this requires the most in terms of new art, so we explored how to visualize these changes early on. We expect you have some questions:

How do I decoy, without confusing my team?

Given the fast-paced, millisecond reaction speed nature of VALORANT gameplay, we needed to clearly differentiate:

As an ally of Yoru, you will be to tell that it is his copy, and not the real Yoru. This is so that Yoru is not accidentally confusing his allies between who the real one is, and who the copy is.
As an enemy of Yoru, they will see an identical copy of Yoru.
During playtests we found that the copy was effective at disrupting an enemies moment-to-moment gameplay—which is awesome—but not when your team gets confused. Below are some of the early explorations for how to visualize the ally Yoru copy.Decoy_Material_Thumbnails_2.jpg
How do I look when exploding?!

There needs to be cohesion with what the decoy looks like, how it looks when starting to explode (so that you know something is about to happen) and finally the effect. All of these come together to create a thematically cohesive moment that also communicates the gameplay clearly. Some early explorations down that route.

Flash_States_Pose_Presentation_2.jpg


GATECRASH

Not much has changed with this one since the last post, aside from the team creating the additional art elements needed to bring this portion of Yoru’s update to life. The big thing here is the “puddle” left on the ground after a fake teleport. While the goal of the fake teleport is to create confusion about Yoru’s location, you should be able to go to where the fake teleport occurred, and then understand whether the real Yoru is around, or was it a misdirection?


DIMENSIONAL DRIFT

OK, prepare for a text dump. Here’s a summary of the changes during Yoru’s ult:

Yoru is no longer revealed to enemies
Yoru is able to cast all utility while in Dimensional Drift
Enemies can hear Yoru’s footsteps
Nearsighted is removed
Unequip delay time is increased slightly
Cast delay added when casting Dimensional Drift, preventing the invulnerability frame on cast.
So what were the goals here?


When looking at updating Yoru’s ultimate, we wanted to fix some of the unintended play patterns that have shown up in-game, and instead give Yoru the tools to gain ground on enemies using stealth and initiate the rest of his team to follow.

Reducing the amount of time he can stay invisible should also stop the “invincible” Yoru from simply dancing in his enemy’s face. The new unequip time is meant to hinder the combo of blasting Shorty right after switching to visible. An added delay to his invulnerability stops Yoru from relying too much on running around with his mask in his hand and jamming it on at the first sight of danger.

Instead, Yoru can now see the battlefield unhindered, allowing him to enter enemy zones, take in the state of the map and mastermind a play— based around Yoru’s change that allows abilities during his ult.

Imagine a Yoru that can send teleporters into new places—deep behind enemy lines, place flashes to move enemies off angles for his team, or possibly land the perfect blind to mask his “de-stealth” and claim a frag. We think this update unlocks a lot of new possibilities for a Drifting Yoru, and we hope that it helps bring some of his fantasy of stealth infiltration to life.
With 2021 wrapping ( ;_; where did the year go?) I wanted to send out one more update and give some insight into next year. But first, thank you to everyone who has played VALORANT over this past year. It’s been a wild ride, the fan art, cosplay, memes, hype af plays—all have been more than we could have ever imagined.

I mean we hoped for it, but to actually have it happen blew us away. Hopping into a match and getting to frag out with y’all has been a blast, it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity and we’re looking forward to making more dope stuff next year.

AGENTS YEAR IN REVIEW
Consider this: Within one hour of launching an Agent, they get more total hours of play than all the months of internal playtesting combined.

Yoru tore his way into games, but for some of you, he fell flat on his promise (catch up on those plans in our Yoru article!). Astra map control saw heavy presence in coordinated play. KAY/O suppressed everyone in his path, while at the same time the Patch 3.0 econ changes shook up who and what was played across the board. Viper created some sharp meta shifts, giving her a more prominent home on maps like Icebox and Breeze. Currently, Breach is seeing refreshed life on Fracture as well.

Chamber appeared to close out the year, holding down sites with extreme precision. We have seen many players from different playstyles pick him up, and stick with him. He’s currently settling into his own spot within the roster, and we're excited to see how he evolves and shakes up pro play in the coming year.

Y’all are adapting in new and amazing ways and it’s what keeps VALORANT evolving. We can’t wait to see how you use what we have planned for you in 2022 :)

Speaking of which...

EARLY 2022 BALANCE
Since Patch 3.0, we know things on the Agent balance side have been lighter than our previous Episodes, and going into 2022, we’re looking to change that. We spent a lot of time towards the end of 2021 looking at how we work, restructuring some of the team, re prioritizing work, and welcoming many new members to the team.

What does all of this mean to you? Throughout 2022 you should see a bigger focus on Agent balance. Y’all should be seeing updates to various Agents across the board throughout the first six months of the year, additionally we will be focusing more on addressing emergent balance issues faster than we did in 2021. As those updates are locked down, we will share that information with y’all before they go live. Keep your eyes peeled throughout the year!

THE NEXT AGENT
Mga kaibigan ko,

I’m not sure if this is tradition at this point, but I know many of you immediately scroll to the bottom just to see what is on the horizon. Hopefully all of us are going into next year with renewed energy, ready to take on new and unexpected challenges. Kicking off next year is an Agent who can outpace the rest of the roster, shocking the competition, and sliding straight into the fight.

Before they arrive, we are going to take our usual winter break, recharge, and amp ourselves up for next year.
Ryan “Rycoux” Cousart, game/character designer, is here with me (John Goscicki, character producer) to be upfront with where Yoru is at and where he’s headed. But before we dig into some of the details of what we are looking to do, we wanted to outline our thought process going into Yoru’s update.

It’s fair to say that when Yoru launched there was a TON of excitement around this boyo, but as y’all experimented with him, many of you hit the conclusion that his outputs were not on par with the rest of the roster. We took the time to really look at what Yoru should be offering, and give him more/different tools to bring to life an effective version of the fantasy y’all have latched onto.

So without me blabbering on more, let's hand this over to the person behind the recent design work on Yoru. He has videos!

Ep1_a1_article_Divider_yoru.jpg

DESIGN GOALS: WHAT’S CHANGING?
Hello, again everyone :D

I’m usually constrained to 280 characters when talking about Yoru, so I’m excited to use infinite space to talk about what we’ve been cooking. As John mentioned, we were floored by the excitement for Yoru and our vision for what he could offer to the roster—but felt there were some gaps we needed to address.

Your feedback along with the gameplay from those of you that have tried to make Yoru work has sparked a vision we are hoping to ignite: Yoru becomes a master of deception through an increased output of disinformation from round to round.

So what does this mean?

We’ve learned that in addition to our duelists needing to offer something unique to the field, they also need to have a strong baseline value that any team at any round can rely on in order to maintain strong viability on any team composition. Yoru’s payoff “dream plays” seem to only happen after rounds of conditioning the enemy, which can leave him ineffective for longer than we’d like.

In short, the aim is for Yoru to have better tools to trick opponents, a stronger baseline value across his kit, and higher impact per round. But what does this all look like? Please consider everything below a work in progress and not final change notes.

IT GO RIGHT FOOT UP, LEFT FOOT FAKEOUT
The first ability to look at is Fakeout, the footsteps decoy that drove a lot of the deceptive plays that we loved to see. To help with Yoru’s mind games, we’ve decided to replace the footsteps with a new visual: a carbon copy of Yoru that runs forward, and upon getting shot, will wind up and explode, debuffing enemies.

BLACK LEATHER GLOVES, NEW SEQUENCE
With Gatecrash, we’ve lowered the range at which enemies can see and hear the tether on the map while it travels. We’ve also increased its travel speed by 20%. In addition to these quality of life improvements, Yoru can now activate the tether from a distance to trigger a fake teleport, playing the same audio and visuals as if he were teleporting.


EITHER WAY, WE ‘BOUT TO DRIFT
We're not ready to share all the changes we're testing internally on Yoru right now, but we're confident our rework will help unlock Yoru's potential. This may include testing a few changes to Dimensional Drift help Yoru break sites wide open.

THE NEXT UPDATE
Although we’re confident these changes will help Yoru get to a better state, when he drops early next year, we’ll continue to monitor them to ensure we can quickly make adjustments accordingly. I know you’ve been waiting, but we hope you all end up having as much fun as we’ve had with Yoru (internally) and I’m stoked to see everything you can soon teach us about Yoru and his fresh gear.

Thank you for sticking with us through this journey, we hope this visibility helps bridge the gap between now, and when he (re)launches. We'll post probably just one more of these Yoru specials before his rework drops early next year. In that article, expect to see art updates that go into supporting these changes.

THE VIPER EXPERIMENT

Per the last State of the Agents, Viper’s recent balance was a test of a new approach where we go all-in with Agents that are struggling. Now that the newest version of Viper has been out for a while, we’ve had enough time to evaluate whether this first attempt worked. 

We’re noticing that Viper’s niche is more distinctly carved out across all skill bands. Now that we’re seeing her playrate increase, we’ll monitor to see if she’s still too oppressive post-nerf, as both sides are playing against her utility. 

Y’all should be able to appreciate and succeed within the unique playspace that each Agent occupies, and this approach for Viper is a nudge in that direction. That said, there are some rough edges here we may need to smooth out. 

FUTURE BALANCE

We are looking into releasing updates to Breach, Skye, Yoru, and Astra. 

Breach / Skye
The goal here is to provide Breach and Skye with more self-sufficiency, to do so, we’re looking to remove their ability to dish out 3 consecutive flashes.
For Breach we are looking to balance power across his kit, instead of it all sitting on his flash.
Yoru
We’re exploring an increase to the power within his unique playspace.
One of the big opportunities here is to make “Fakeout” a more impactful ability.
Astra
The galaxy brain Agent provides a specific playstyle to the game, but we’re looking to take some steps to add more counterplay to some of her play patterns that are too oppressive in coordinated play.
Barring resource constraints or development hiccups, you should start to see these changes roll out around Patch 3.0, and hopefully no later than 3.02.

NEW AGENTS

As you saw the latest Act, there was no new Agent bundled with the launch of Breeze. To reiterate; this is because we're prioritizing quality over speed—VALORANT is a game played on the slimmest of margins and we want to make sure everything we put out has the level of refinement you expect.

That said, expect a new Agent for Patch 3.0 :) 

This time around we are throwing in some abilities that should feel familiar to folks who’ve played traditional FPS games their whole lives, but with added elements that will make those recognizable abilities unique within our roster. This is an Agent who’s utility can create moments where you must rely on your gunplay.

Our hope is that the @*&#*&!(&H! #$ &*! *%# &@! *U&^A! “@*!!*(@@*&^” (@&* ^@!^& &@! *&# &^C#^ANG W*^@ $O )(E&# *N@! S!T#$

Huh, I’m sorry my keyboard just stopped working there… oh well. The new Agent is coming soon enough, and we’re looking forward to seeing what you think when they finally say hello! 
VIPER

There’ve been quite a few explorations on Viper over the past few months. After many iterations, we've decided on a direction that should sharpen the ways in which she is uniquely powerful without homogenizing her with other Controllers—and in other ways, push her thematic fantasy.

Her Poison Cloud is unique to her zonal control gameplay and thematic, but feels like it lacks the impact we’d want on her base abilities round over round. Amping up that damage threat is our main goal this time around.

We believe that part of what sets Viper apart is that she makes big bets with her map control. She picks a location, gets set, and dares opponents to take the fight in her world. With that in mind, the Patch 2.06 changes are aimed at increasing that threat to a new level. Internally these changes have been very strong, and we’re excited to see how Viper performs with this buff out in the wild. The team also feels like we’re well positioned to tune her as needed moving forward.

YORU

Our first update to Yoru in 2.03 was aimed mainly at quality of life improvements, but this time around we’re hoping to move the needle on his power and overall impact.

We think the updates to Gatecrash unlock numerous new play patterns for Yoru and should allow him to apply more of the pressure and mind games he promised at launch. We’re excited to see how this pairs with the buff to Blindside and the added ability to escape bad situations during Dimensional Drift with a little proactive setup.

Given Yoru’s unique space in the game, we’re going to keep a close eye on him and learn how the balance levers he provides affect his impact in the live game.
APPROACH TO BALANCE

VALORANT is now nine months post launch (omg it's been nine months o_o). In that span we’ve learned alot about the impact of our approach to Agent balance. Our previous method was to make small, targeted changes to Agents in hopes that we’d see incremental impact.

Ultimately this approach has not panned out like we hoped. Starting with 2.06, we’re taking a more aggressive approach with our updates, so that we see a larger impact to Agents with each one. This is because we know seeing your Agent in the patch notes over and over can be frustrating, especially when they do not move the needle, so to speak.

As much as we want to get Agent updates out, we also highly value stability in esports and don’t want the entire game meta to shift under our pros’ feet leading into events like Masters and Champions.

With Masters 1 behind us you’re going to see us try out a few things. Viper is up first. Then, as Masters 2 approaches, we’ll evaluate the changes and stabilize versus making large changes as we feel is necessary. Throughout 2021, you should see this pattern: Once a large tourney concludes, we’ll release some larger impact buffs/nerfs, and as the next large one approaches, slow down and focus on stabilization.
It’s John Gosicki, character producer here for another look at our Agents today and tomorrow. We skipped January, but we’re here now! Let's go into it. Last time we hit two big topics: Controllers and hinting at Yoru…who well, isn’t a secret anymore, he’s here, in the game now, shooting people o_o

With Brimstone and Omen changes live since 2.0, we’re seeing them settle into some healthier places. Right now, there is a more even choice competition between the two of them that highlight their respective strengths.

That leaves us with one more Controller though.

VIPER
Many of you have been perusing the patch notes, waiting for some larger updates to address issues that Viper’s run into. I’m gonna be the bearer of bad news that the next patch is not when you’ll see that update. We need to spend more time really defining where she fits within the choice competition among Brimstone and Omen.

She has a really unique spot within the roster, and we want to make sure that any work we do goes towards highlighting the specific play patterns she represents, in conjunction with her power fantasy.

Yoru-banner.png

YORU
Yoru tore his way into the fight this year, and we’re stoked to see how excited y’all have been to play him. (I personally may have already bought Yoru stickers for my notebook :P thank you for the fan art!).

It’s only been a few weeks since he launched but we’ve noticed that mastery of his infiltration tools are not leading to the level of success we’d hoped for. So, given the current state of Yoru, we’re looking into some near future buffs.

WHAT YOU’RE ALL HERE FOR
So….um, this leaves us with the future. Y’all have been asking for another Controller, and well, that’s what you’re getting next!

As we’ve discussed before, we’re trying to push the boundaries when it comes to Agent abilities in VALORANT, and so far, everything we’ve thrown at you has been less disruptive than we thought they’d be. That said, our next Controller is a cosmic shift from the play patterns you’ve grown accustomed to. This one is for all you “galaxy brain” players out there that like to study everything that happens on a map.

There are still a few topics we’d like to dive into, but that will come in a different article. So keep and eye out over the coming weeks for some deep discussions on VALORANT Agents.
Howdy friends, with 2020 almost behind us we wanted to take a moment to talk about our current, high level thoughts around Agents, and a bit about how we are thinking of the future.

When the game launched we were focused on getting all the extreme outliers into a reasonable place. Right now things are fairly stable, but there are still some Agents/Classes that need some deeper thought put into them.


CONTROLLER POWER, DUELISTS VS INITIATORS
In particular, we have some plans to address the total power of Controllers (Omen, Viper, Brimstone) and to better differentiate the roles of Duelists and Initiators. At a high level, we want to encourage people to play with their teammates as much as possible and we believe that giving our Initiator and Controller roles a bit more team-focused power will help achieve that end. We are aiming to have our first set of changes to Controllers launching with Episode 2 and additional changes to Initiators and Duelists throughout Q1 of 2021.

With the release of Killjoy we felt that the Agents within Valorant have a good range of abilities to either augment, or enhance our core Tac Loop (Someday we will make a post about this). Even before the game launched we were feeling that there were some gaps within the abilities/tools Agents provided, this was evident due to there only being two Agents (Sova and Breach) with tools to break onto sites, the class known as Initiators. With all of that in mind, we quickly got to work on another Initiator, Skye. She not only provides crucial tools to break onto sites, but also per-round healing choice competition with Sage.


NEW AGENTS, MORE RISKS
From the start our goal with Agents is that they have a unique spot within the roster. Whenever a new Agent drops it keeps the game feeling fresh, making you rethink all of your current tactics, and form new ones that build on all the skills you have learned so far. Now that the basics are in place, we are going to take more risks with what each Agent introduces to the game, pushing some boundaries, and evolving what is possible in an ability based tac shooter.

For now we are keeping these boundary-pushing ideas a secret.

That said, we wanted to sneak some insight into the future here. The year will tear open with a Duelist for all you “lurkers” out there, who will keep you on your toes around which angles are truly safe.
